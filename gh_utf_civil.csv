Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications?,civil
I am a bit lost in the source code,civil
My sincere apologies if I missed something.,civil
"If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done.",civil
"I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/).",civil
I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port.,civil
"I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago.",civil
I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills.,civil
Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work.,civil
It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table.,civil
I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in.,civil
It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts.,civil
If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen.,civil
I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart!,civil
I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported.,civil
"I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on.",civil
This would really help modularizing our code,civil
"The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate.",civil
"They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone.",civil

Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys.,civil
It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities.,civil
Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-),civil
"don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here.",civil
Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified.,civil
Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter.,civil

"And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness",civil
We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required.,civil
I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows.,civil
"Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential.",civil
"We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map!",civil
"Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good.",civil
Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-(,civil
It's possible you misunderstood the comment.,civil
"Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF.",civil
"The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :(",civil
it seems you're a little too caffeinated here :,civil
Mike you are a valued JIT contributor,civil
I didn't really think about it too much.,civil
I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here.,civil
I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional.,civil
It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing.,civil
"If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it.",civil
"I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense.",civil
I can very much relate to that.,civil
But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior.,civil
Let's just say that it is distasteful.,civil
I honestly don't follow any more,civil
"Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you?",civil
It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too.,civil
"Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation.",civil
So excuse me if this is how you felt.,civil
"Seriously, have I done something to you?",civil
I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer.,civil
Report it to npm,civil
Stop taking money for something that should be free and open.,civil
"I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).",civil
It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue.,civil
"I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this.",civil
"I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way.",civil
Just be decent and follow the community's rules.,civil
"If you are going to rant, go to twitter.",civil
Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on.,civil
"In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed.",civil
Let's all be respectful.,civil
Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter.,civil
Find one that you are satisfied with and use it.,civil
Grow up and move along.,civil
I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved,civil
"We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build.",civil
I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you.,civil
I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better.,civil
I empathize with your frustration,civil
Life is too short,civil
"And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse.",civil
Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft...,civil
I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know,civil
They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months.,civil
" @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months.",civil
"Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"".""",civil
I know this wasn't your intention,civil
I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :(,civil
"Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me.",civil
"I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens.",civil
"If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know.",civil
"And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on""""",civil
It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does,civil

"I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer.",civil
"Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world.",civil
"Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed.",civil

"I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past.",civil
"So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view.",civil
"I feel your points. They burn us, too.",civil
My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?),civil
I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand.,civil
I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble.,civil
"make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`.",civil

"I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response.",civil
At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue.,civil
So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet?,civil
"Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent?",civil
I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015,civil

Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved?,civil
"Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against).",civil
I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options.,civil
I'm happy to clarify any of my points.,civil
If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :),civil
"it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar.",civil
I certain see how it can be a bug.,civil
"Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/",civil
"I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces**",civil
"I don't disagree with that,",civil

"It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution.",civil
"this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur.""""",civil
bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable.,civil
"If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend.",civil
"Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had.",civil
I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern.,civil
Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way.,civil
It was never our intention,civil
we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs,civil
"We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios.",civil
Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window?,civil
"If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution",civil
"I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you.",civil
Two minds being better than one and all that :),civil
"If that changes in the future, let me know.",civil
My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome,civil
It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have,civil
You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios.,civil
It is very disappointed,civil
I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed,civil
I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ...,civil
And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking,civil
"when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read.",civil

Go and learn some manners!,civil
"I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation?",civil
If they make fool of me it's not my fault,civil

It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults.,civil
