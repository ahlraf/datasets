Sure, we could have deprecated the old console and parked the console subsystem and implemented a new PTY subsystem. That's a path we could have taken, but that would have left everyone with an existing console application asking ""why did Microsoft deprecate their entire console API with no plan to modernize those existing apps? Are they *fools*?""  We're just now in a place where the console subsystem *can* support conpty, where it can support other rendering heads, and where the backing buffer could possibly support emoji and other unicode codepoints. It might not be the path that makes *you* the most happy, but it's the path that makes the most developers the most happy.  We're working on a new rendering head.

I haven't personally debugged into this issue, but my gut agrees with Rich's analysis that the issue is coming from GDI. I certainly wouldn't call this a major perf regression, and I doubt it's due to any of our code in particular. It's likely just due to a really old CPU-bound graphics API that's not optimized for running on new hardware.  As warrenrumak mentioned, if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode.","I know it always seems like a fine and dandy idea to say ""hey we're going to break back-compat for thousands of existing apps so we can add some new features for people"" but we like to hold ourselves to a higher standard than that. We've found a path where we can do good for all of the existing users of the console codebase, and slowly introduce new features and modernize, without leaving customers behind.  Sure, we could have deprecated the old console and parked the console subsystem and implemented a new PTY subsystem. That's a path we could have taken, but that would have left everyone with an existing console application asking ""why did Microsoft deprecate their entire console API with no plan to modernize those existing apps? Are they *fools*?""  We're just now in a place where the console subsystem *can* support conpty, where it can support other rendering heads, and where the backing buffer could possibly support emoji and other unicode codepoints. It might not be the path that makes *you* the most happy, but it's the path that makes the most developers the most happy.  We're working on a new rendering head. No commitments as to when it'll be finished, but we're working on it. When it's done, then that will likely resolve the performance issues described in this thread. I haven't personally debugged into this issue, but my gut agrees with Rich's analysis that the issue is coming from GDI. I certainly wouldn't call this a major perf regression, and I doubt it's due to any of our code in particular. It's likely just due to a really old CPU-bound graphics API that's not optimized for running on new hardware.  As warrenrumak mentioned, if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff"" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)."""

Therefore I don't think it's valid to judge peoples' comments here as what they would have said in an actual RFC.

There's also lots of not OSS software that is free as in beer. And I appreciate that this is true, but being ""non-OSS"" would not preclude this from happening by default anyway.

A similar disclaimer could be added to published projects that contain translate blocks, to prevent misunderstandings.  You should also be aware that grammar errors in machine translation results can be detrimental to foreign language learning, because the grammar errors will imprint themselves on students' visual memories and these memory imprints are very hard to get rid of. For example, although I have been called ""as fluent as a Bard"" by native speakers, I still have difficulty with vowel length after over a decade of learning Gaelic, because I have seen too many texts where the accents on the vowels were missing.  Here's a real-life example of machine translation grammar errors from the English - German language pair. I have left the airport a note and they have now corrected it. Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda"" is too informal for a disclaimer."""

Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste Firstly, the Angular repository receives **hundreds** of issues a day. The issue template ensure that the report is structured so the team can understand the issue quickly.    Problem: Reactive forms  div with [ngClass] directive:   f is a getter in .ts file that returns all controls (and work everywhere else)  d-none is bootstrap display:none class  this is a select/option dropdown which if !==1 shows div else hides it as you can guess   When dropdown activated manually it works  when the dropdown changes because changed from code (using your (change) method binding)  it doesn't change Because you change the DOM, but didn't change the ControlValueAccessor behind it. I suggest you use this  instead.  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases?

It requires a a code-based model. The step from putting a png and a 3-line json model into the resources folder to coding a custom IModel is huge. 2. The quads you add with your model are in model space. They will then be transformed using the Matrix4f derived from the json model. To add a quad that aligns to screen pixels, you need to apply those transforms in reverse and also know what the target coordinates (y!) are.  Both of these tasks are not trivial. Using the BufferBuilder to throw a single colored quad onto the screen *is* trivial, especially as anyone who has ever made a GUI for any block knows how to do it. (and if they don't, the code in renderItemOverlayIntoGUI already does exactly that and can be copied very easily.)  Now, is direct GL access the only way to do that? No, it isn't. I can think of dozens of ways to supply overlays that don't need GL calls but still are much simpler to use than baking models on-the-fly. Even a callback that asks for a texture path + u/v/w/h to overpaint over the item would fulfill 95% of all usescases. But the number 1 solution people will propose when they run into this problem is ""do it like vanilla"".
