The cover letter and the change logs should contain a summary of that discussion and a proper justification of the proposed change.

TL,DR, if you are desperate to fix the problem with this fall through comment  please do so in a way that preserves overall readability.. it would be nice to not blame the existing code for brain damage in GCC and various other static analyzers.. blaming the existing comment for not *properly* marking an intentional fall through is ... rich..

I think this discussion is starting to be counterproductive with arguing of both parts. Unfortunately I don't see anyone given their inputs too..

Given that the structure has already been extended several times  there is pretty much nothing to keep this from happening again and again.. There probably is a decent compromise to find between not accepting a single additional byte and accepting several GB.For example how likely is it that the growth of this structure make it go over a page? I would hope not at all.. Thats a misleading statement.  We've never supported running newer applications on older kernels, and no one is forcing anyone to use the lksctp-tools library,I was only suggesting that, if we were to support this compatibility, that might be a place to offer it.. Also misleading, as it assumes that we're not intentionally doing this.  I get wanting to support running applications built for newer kernels on older kernels, but thats just not something that we do, and to say thats broken is misleading.  Older applications are required to run on newer kernels, but not vice versa, which is what you are asking for.. I won't disagree about the niceness of versioning, but that ship has sailed..
