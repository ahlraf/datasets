not_technical,"DirtyF thanks for the input! im looking for every jekyll plugin i can find, put majority is out of date and has no support, so it pushed me to propose these functions into core (not counting jekyll-originated plugins) should i delete my comments? don't want to overload the tread since im thinking it will grow and going tho useless comments would add some discomfort (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles:"
not_technical,Please please support for i18n. At least 2 languages. Many plug-ins break or don't work with ghpages. build in support for content blocks and components
not_technical,This depends on the Markdown engine. Please ask  on Kramdown or CommonMark First would like to say thank you to the Jekyll team for all the great work you all do. Jekyll is one my favorite frameworks to work with and I really do appreciate what you guys do! Ok on to the request it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. I know there is Jekyll-paginate-v2 gem but it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items.

I know there is Jekyll-paginate-v2 gem but it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. Hello all, my first post so go easy. I want to just say that I love Jekyll, I'm now using it on a lot of my web builds. One thing that has bothered me though, is that I've not been able to take advantage of the latest Jekyll features because a lot of the 3rd party CMS solutions I rely on for my clients use (cloudcannon, siteleaf and forestry) simply don't run the latest versions of Jekyll themselves. This forces me to have my folder structures in a really messy state and not take advantage of the latest features when developing locally. So if anyone at Jekyll could bend a few arms to get them to update that would be fab."
not_technical,(I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. Some of the biggest reasons are auto-prefixing for Sass and the ability to use ES6 syntax that can automatically be polyfilled with babel. I think having an automated tool handle the sass and javascript bits may speed up the compile time of Jekyll.
not_technical,"It always take some time to update to the latest version for services like GitHub Pages, Forestry, CloudCannon or Siteleaf because they need to run tests and adapt their tools. There's nothing Jekyll's core team can do about it. I would like to see Nested Collections. I know there are alternatives to do this. But still if the Jekyll team can make it easier, that would be awesome.!"
not_technical,"I would like to see Nested Collections. I know there are alternatives to do this. But still if the Jekyll team can make it easier, that would be awesome.! I would like to see reading metadata in separate files"
not_technical,"Great suggestion. I'll add a use case: - Create a collection of static image files - Add metadata (like alt text, captions, dimensions) in sidecar files - Loop through them to create a rich image gallery  Jekyll CMS services like Siteleaf could make great use of this feature. Siteleaf uploads static assets to an  uploads collection. cc sskylar I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. Thanks!"
not_technical,"When I see the repo, I though GitHub pages. It has similarity between.  sidebar.md,  footer.md etc.. I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. With the stellar rise of ""headless"" (= API only) SaaS CMS systems [static site generators ](url)have become the tool of choice for types of sites that they have not been considered for in the past.  e.g. contentful.com  provides an official jekyll plugin that pulls all the CMS content into the Jekyll  data folder as yaml.  You can then use that content inside pages and include you've already created, but you can't actively create new pages from the SaaS CMS.  This is possible with other generators, but I'd like to stick with Jekyll due to your maturity and ecosystem.  e.g. the site I'm maintaining is a mix of content maintained by techies directly in the jekyll git and content written and uploaded by less technical people in contentful. contentful triggers the redeploy on netlify.com  via  webhook when a new article was published.  Overall a great stack, just that we have to rely on a somewhat unmaintained hacky ""page generator"" jekyll plugin to stitch it together."
not_technical,"A big reason for me when doing frontend work and the Sass folder has many nested folders and files Jekyll sass can be slow. I have found letting web pack handle the sass instead of Jekyll improves speed and developer happiness. I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows.  Rails, Flask, Phoenix and Node applications that I've worked with all work fine in Docker for Windows. You volume mount in the code, make a change, and in milliseconds your change is reflected and ready to be seen in a browser.  With Jekyll 3.8, this does not happen. The file change is reflected inside of the container, but the jekyll serve command doesn't regenerate the file. Using --force polling also doesn't work.  Everything works fine under WSL (without Docker) but Jekyll is the only reason I have Ruby installed on my machine, mainly because every other app from every other language / framework works wonderfully with Docker.  Call me crazy but I don't think 4.0 should ship until this is addressed. Not being able to Dockerize a Jekyll site for development with Docker for Windows is a huge bummer."
not_technical,"Can you elaborate? Do you mean something like includes? I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. Thus, we could define in  config.yml This way one could create partials of .coffee in well-structured folders with all of them compiling minified to one .js file, even same way as you have css/style.sass with all the imports of individual Sass files."

not_technical,"I'd like an additional YAML file that defines site-wide variables so other programs can generate the file safely (instead of appending to  config.yml).  It could be better if we can have something like {% include vars.yml %} in  config.yml but I don't think it's necessary. Just allow loading extra variables from another file, even if the file name is hard-coded, would be enough.  A typical use case would be when I write a custom script that pre-processes some file and show in the information generated site with something like {{ site.my preprocessor.info }}. My current approach of appending to  config.yml would pollute the file. With another file enabled, I can keep my configuration file safe by ignoring the dedicated variable YML in .gitignore. Make internal linking easier. Like generating a JSON of internals links including anchors."
not_technical,"Don't parse these conditional blocks unless the plugin is available, so code inside doesn't crash if the plugin isn't available.   alzeih This cannot be implemented because Liquid is parsed and rendered by the liquid gem. Jekyll only provides the means to use and extend Liquid constructs for use in template files.  This would be such a useful feature, I wonder if we could find a workaround. Maybe instead of using the regular {% if %} tag, we create a new tag that acts like the {% raw %} tag (so Liquid does not parse the contents), and then  Jekyll  will render the contents if the plugin is installed.  This is just an ideas list. Let's not let implementation details get in the way at this stage. We are programmers,  anything  is possible. Wow!! That's an awesome idea!!! We can easily create a new tag that is a combination of both raw and if tags... :heart: :tada:"
not_technical,"Pluginfile is not similar to Deliverfile and other configuration files: When you add a plugin, some code is added to your Gemfile that includes Pluginfile there. Gemfile (and the included information from your Pluginfile) is used to define which gems to install when you run bundle install on your project.   So to implement a method like the one you want, at runtime in fastlane, you would then have to change both the Gemfile to include the new imported data, and run bundle install. It would change files on the file system and also  Probably that would still not work? When running fastlane command via bundle exec no other gem can be loaded as  bundler  disallows loading gems that are not in the bundle. So when import from git is called in  fastlane  runtime,  bundler  runtime environment has already been created and won't allow any other gems to be loaded.  However, the only solution that comes to my mind, to make it work with  bundler , would be to nest another call to bundle exec but with a temporary Gemfile. This temporary  Gemfile  would include all the entries from a  project   Gemfile / Pluginfile  and all the entries from an  imported   Gemfile / Pluginfile  (as  Gemfile  is actually calling eval gemfile on a  Pluginfile  so it is like those entries would be in a  Gemfile ). No modification of a current  Gemfile  or any other file is needed.  But this is  **not a good** idea ,), and it would only work if import from git was at the beginning of a  Fastfile  - it would be the most convenient to just call bundle exec with the same command and parameters as the original one. One caveat of it is that it nests with each import from git call over and over again... The other one is that if import from git is not placed at the top of a  Fastfile  it means some lanes or anything else might already been executed and would require to somehow reuse this  fastlane  state in a new bundle exec call... Terrible idea that is why I am hiding it in the details ˜  So I guess it **cannot** be done due to usage of  bundler . **But** if one is **not using**  bundler  in a project (and hence both  Gemfile  and  Pluginfile ), then they could just add plugins via fastlane require action in a project  Fastfile  or in an imported  Fastfile . This can be done in the current version of  fastlane  and it works. Anyway, if this is not possible, can we add a note in import from git description with reasoning if any?   Documentation of that actions says:    Import another Fastfile from a remote git repository to use its lanes   That is pretty clear that this action is for importing Fastfiles.  Exactly, that is why I was surprised that it imports all the files of custom actions as well and not only a  Fastfile  ,). It is not even mentioned. And as plugins are just actions this is probably why people think that remote plugins should be imported or actually expect them to be imported implicitly like in a case of custom actions. Besides, searching for issues regarding import from git and  Pluginfile  yields a lot of results so it seems like it is not so obvious for people and they constantly ask to support  Pluginfile  in import from git. Hence, I think an explanation with a good reasoning would be welcomed. Maybe it would be great to add a warning when import from git detects a  Pluginfile  to remind that plugins should be installed/updated. I think it would follow  fastlane philosophy .   What do you mean by that? How should this work?  What I meant is that when import from git detects a  remote   Pluginfile  (meaning in the same directory as the  Fastfile  it tries to import) it could print a warning listing the plugin names and saying that in order to use this  remote   Fastfile  these plugins are required to be in a  local   Pluginfile . It could even compare a  local   Pluginfile  with a remote one and throw an error when it detects that plugins from a remote are not included in the local one. It would be very informative and helpful. Or  fastlane require plugin  could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project  Pluginfile ?  Doesn't this already happen when you use an action of a plugin, that is not installed?  Yes I know that calling a plugin action would end up with an error but a usage of such an action might be somewhere far down the lanes ˜„  i.e. after a long build or anything else. I think it is better to prevent such a  Fastfile  from running at all as it will almost certainly finish with an error - so why wait for that? This is just another way of prevention I have described above. This time using a fastlane require plugin as an action in a  remote   Fastfile . Instead of adding a  remote   Pluginfile  (like in a case above and handle that  Pluginfile  in import from git) you could specify directly in a  remote   Fastfile  that some plugins are required via fastlane require plugin action - this would work like in a case above - check if these plugins are in a  local   Pluginfile  and then throw an error if missing.  Both of these preventions of course make sense if one is using  bundler ,  Gemfile  and  Pluginfile . Otherwise it is enough to use the current fastlane require action and it will install a particular plugin gem (if necessary) upon running any lane from such a  Fastfile . So now both usages are handled.  That being said: You can of course create an action in your shared Fastfile that does exactly what I described above. Download some file, edit Pluginfile (or create it if it doesn'T exist) or add it additionally to Gemfile, then run bundle install using the sh() action. That would effectively ""force-install"" a plugin when your imported Fastfile is used. Would that solve your problem?  Like I said above, if I use  bundler  it is almost impossible (see details at the top). If I don't use  bundler  (and thus neither  Gemfile  nor  Pluginfile ) I can just require my plugins via fastlane require and they will be installed if necessary. **But** if one is **not using**  bundler  in a project (and hence both  Gemfile  and  Pluginfile ), then they could just add plugins via fastlane require action in a project  Fastfile  or in an imported  Fastfile . If you install a plugin, you always configure fastlane to use bundler: Plugins are (by definition) gems loaded from rubygems. That is the difference to a local custom action. Besides that I honestly don't follow any more. Maybe create a new issue with just the actual  problem  you want to solve, and not suggestion for the solution."

Come on, I know they are gems and normally you use  bundler  for plugins. **One thing** is that I am providing a **workaround** for import from git to work with plugins but without  bundler . As  Pluginfile  requires  bundler  and such a usage cannot be supported in import from git action. Put this in a remote  Fastfile  and you can just use this action in a lane like that: when you **import** this  Fastfile  in another one it will also **work**, providing that you do not use  bundler .. **The second** thing is that in my previous comment I have suggested adding some **improvements** (prevention steps) either in a form of a new action fastlane require plugin or additional safety-checks in import from git action to help mitigate issues when using plugins in a  remote   Fastfile  (in a normal way with  bundler ). As this issue is a  Feature   Request  I was hoping to discuss all that and at the same time be proactive and bring up some ideas. By looking at  fastlane  issues I can see that using a  shared   Fastfile  where one would like to use some plugins, is a problem raised many times and it probably needs some support. So when using  bundler  and importing a  remote   Fastfile  it **cannot** be **guaranteed** that all the plugins used in this  remote   Fastfile  are installed **locally**. What is more, it can be even unknown what plugins are required (without looking at the source of the  remote   Fastfile ) as there is no need to create (although it would be reasonable) a  Pluginfile  for this  remote   Fastfile . And as you can have multiple projects using a  shared   Fastfile  and/or multiple  shared   Fastfiles  it is easy to lose track of which plugins are required where - hence I wanted to improve that by giving some hints when importing a  shared/remote Fastfile. Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. ˜„ Otherwise, I cannot help you understand. If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? By the way, I do not think spawning yet another issue on the same subject is going to help solve anything. Even more, I do not think that ""the actual problem"" I want to solve and ""a suggestion for the solution"" of this problem should be in separate threads?! ˜ What are you saying?"
not_technical,"Well, now I am wishing you good luck in your search for a solution. I am not interested in spending more time on this.  Great attitude janpio, especially as a  fastlane  collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping  fastlane ... Is that what you guys do in here? I posted a reply in the heat of a discussion. Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. Now you post a selected part of that deleted comment again. This is highly inappropriate.  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you?  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way."
not_technical,"Personally, I understand both sides.  One thinks it would be obvious for plugins to ""just work"" too, while I clearly understand why is not feasible, and I'd argue that it's actually incorrect. You use a dependency manager to install the required dependencies and then run something that uses them, it would be weird for the thing you run to install dependencies for you.  Knowing this, another way to improve this is what Skoti already mentioned, and which I always love: automatically prevent incorrect usages. So the current options seems to be: 1. Warn users (UI.important) when they import from git and a Pluginfile also exists in that remote. 2. Create a separate action (ensure plugins?) that ensures that all the required plugins (defined in the local and in the remote Pluginfiles) are available (could be ""harder"" because of this) And as always, PRs welcome! Well I didn't feel of this as being a heated discussion. So excuse me if this is how you felt. Anyway, it is nice to know now that you have realized it was a bad move and deleted the comment. However, I quoted the whole part not a selected one as you suggest.  And I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. And now you make another comment in a similar style ˜ :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? Seriously, have I done something to you?"

I only have a 16 GB SSD to play with and once you factor in the Chrome OS, Xubuntu and the necessary software that comes with them, there isn't much room left. I currently only have 2.5 GB left so Atom is taking up 10% of that. **I do not think** it is a good idea to close this, even have a plan to reduce the size of atom, why not keep this open as a place where can remind us we have a really important thing to do. not just a idea. paulcbetts, I want to speak directly, the words ""very cheap to buy a USB"" seems really ridiculous. if that is right, why not make atom more bigger, to 2G. or what else...... what is the meaning of one software which exist? especially loved by people. that is ..... everyone knows it. maybe you will tell me, Atom is a open source, you just work for it as volunteer.

The other day I saw this video from the ACLU about a toddler who after being separated from his family for several months could no longer look his mother in the face:  Those with a background in early childhood development can tell you that severe cases of neglect at an early age can and will cause severe developmental delays and disabilities. They will grow up feeling detached, they will have deep rooted trust issues, and they will have an inability to feel empathy. The actions of ICE have had a lasting lifelong impact on these children, and many of them won't even remember it happening.  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel.  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse.  There is one thing I have control over, and that's open source. Open source has always been a way that I try to make the world a better place. Bringing new contributions to the community helps drives innovation and competition.  Lerna is a perfect example of that. Historically monorepos required a lot of infrastructure and only large teams and companies could afford to set it up and maintain it. They had a very expensive cost to them. Lerna made it available to everyone and the community has flourished around it.  Tool after tool, this is what we accomplish with open source. This is what we contribute back to the world. But today I want to do something more.  As we've learned over the last few years with Facebook, Uber, Google, and others. Tech companies do a lot of shady things behind the scenes.  Recently it's come out that a lot of big tech companies are supporting ICE by providing them with infrastructure and in some cases doing significant development work for them. They all have their excuses, but the fact is that these companies care only about the millions of dollars that ICE is paying them and are willing to ignore all the horrible things that ICE does.  Recently it has come to my attention that many of these companies which are being paid millions of dollars by ICE are also using some of the open source software that I helped build.  Now, it's not news to me that people can use open source for evil. That's part of the whole deal.  But it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. It doesn't feel like there are enough steps in between me and the horrible things ICE is doing.  So my plan now is to start licensing my software differently.  I have spoken to Sebastian and Daniel about this and we all want Lerna to do the same.  For the companies that are known supporters of ICE: Lerna will no longer be licensed as MIT for you. You will receive no licensing rights and any use of Lerna will be considered theft. You will not be able to pay for a license, the only way that it is going to change is by you publicly tearing your contracts with ICE."
not_technical,"Please make sure that you amend your page on npmjs.org so that it does not state that the license of the project is ""MIT"". Curious: Do ""parents"" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?"
not_technical,"Are you protesting the right of the United States to choose who to allow to immigrate by deporting illegal aliens, or are you protesting the specific treatment of these illegal aliens in the context of their removal? If it's the former, then there's no point in bringing up their specific treatment as a point for why ICE should be protested (because it would be the case regardless of the treatment of any particular alien), and if it's the latter, then why not specify that, and protest by listing what exactly you would like changed about the treatment of aliens during their deportation? That would make what exactly you are protesting much clearer. I'm adding it to all my repos to prevent the lerna project from being used in any of those projects, both open source and commercial. Just as a matter of principal. Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft..."
not_technical," Lerna team, thank you for taking a stand "
not_technical,"Yep, noted that is is no longer Open Source Software, by definition.  The way this tirefire of a license can be interpreted, is that since a company uses Windows and pays Microsoft, they are complicit. Or Github for that matter, which is owned by Microsoft. Are the Lerna repo maintainers profiting on ICE, in direct opposition to their license? Github free accounts didn't come from nothingness. So what? Maximal open source permissiveness is not automatically correct and just. It's just one option.  And no, the terms are pretty clear, I suggest you read more carefully: ""The following license shall not be granted to the following entities or any subsidiary thereof."" It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products."
not_technical,"I've locked this to contributors for now.  Adding +1 comments is too noisy.  For future reference, add a reaction to the issue body, and don't comment. ##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea  ##### COMPONENT NAME   ##### ANSIBLE VERSION - Paste verbatim output from ""ansible --version"" between quotes below --   ##### CONFIGURATION - If using Ansible 2.4 or above, paste the results. Otherwise, mention any settings you have changed/added/removed in ansible. (or using the ANSIBLE * environment variables).  ##### OS / ENVIRONMENT  ##### SUMMARY  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is ""include playbook"" which would allow a ""when"" to apply to it.  Why?  I have a playbook that performs some maintenance, OS, Kernel, package, and firmware upgrades.  For Major upgrades, we track progress in a ticketing system.  So, during those runs, I'd like to conditionally import a playbook that updates the ticket information.  In order for that to work, I need to pass the user's password to the ticketing system, so there's a vars prompt in the ticket update playbook.  If the user specifies which ticket they're working to the maintenance playbook, I'd like the ticket update playbook to be called after the maintenance is performed.  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful.  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be.  ##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE For bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case. For new features, show how the feature would be used.  - Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below  # Maintenance Play Runs first, then conditionally import a second playbook - import playbook: update-ticket.yaml when: ticket id is defined  You can also paste links for larger files   ##### EXPECTED RESULTS - What did you expect to happen when running the steps above? --  I expect update-ticket.yaml to only import if the ticket id is defined.  ##### ACTUAL RESULTS - What actually happened? If possible run with extra verbosity  no parse error, and playbook update-ticket.yaml is imported 100% of the time."

not_technical,"Please reopen this issue (not sure if OP is still around), this does not fix this issue at all, animating the Sprite Frame property is still incredibly broken in 3.2 Alpha2 as described in the original post of this issue. I have a lot of animations and would really need to have this fixed.  **Minimal test project:** Run the project, click on the color buttons to see a spritesheet animation playing. Each animation plays a separate row of the ""test spritesheet.png"" spritesheet.  To test the issue, - drag the ""test spritesheet expanded.png"" into the Sprite texture, - set ""Hframes"" from 7 to 11 - run the project again to see the wrong cells being displayed in lower rows of the spritesheet (any but green, since green is the first row, the cell attribution for green obviously is unchanged.) #25327 does not fix this issue at all, animating the Sprite Frame property is still incredibly broken in 3.2 Alpha2 as described in the original post of this issue.  This is not broken, as I already explained this is the expected behavior. This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. This should be doable via a script though, using the Animation API."
not_technical,"It is **not** expected  by users  as you can see here in this thread.  Maybe  you  wrote it this way, or studied the source code intensively, then of course you expect to behave it like that, but  users  of the Sprite Frame property obviously don't expect this behavior at all.  How should they expect this behaviour? What would be the underlying intention of a design that allows spritesheets to be extended only vertically, not horizontally? If that's a feature, it's the most stupid feature I've ever heard of. This ""feature"" effectively **breaks** animation as demonstrated in the minimal project and the thorough description of the original post.  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. What ever you call it, it really needs fixing. I therefore once again ask like jaacko-torus for this issue to be reopened. I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. So it **is expected** so that changing the number of column changes the ID of your frames. It's easy to understand, and without considering this texture resize problem, it does the job quite well.   It is not expected by users as you can see here in this thread.  Sorry, but this issue did not receive enough upvotes to be significantly representative about how the feature should work. But anyway, what users think is not what matters to define what is a bug or not. A bug happens when a software does not behave as expected from the programmer point of view, not the user one. The user might just have, like here apparently, misunderstood how the feature was designed and the implied advantages/flaws. So the only bug here is maybe about adding a warning to the documentation, but I don't really call that a bug.   If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least.  Yeah, in that case we can call it bad design. So for now this issue will not be opened again as this is not a bug, and you can now easily workaround it using the frame coords feature. The update the ""frame"" animation to the ""frame coord"" animation is another problem though, so if you face problem updating this should be another issue.  If you have a better design in mind, please open an issue on the godot-proposal repository."

not_technical,"Thanks for the tip!  I chose  not  to add the folder to the PATH, because that's not absolutely required (and I have a theory where adding tons of app folders to the PATH would slow down the system...).  Something worth mentioning: uninstalling will delete where the settings.json file is located (I know, that's part of the ""good"" sandboxing idea beyond store app deployment), so you'll lose your settings if you don't make a copy first.  In the ""XCOPY-deployed"" instance, the settings.json file resides at Windows Terminal. A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. Don't act on theories!"
not_technical,"Now: it seems like the discussion here  has  reached its terminus, so there isn't value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in.

If I file something completely blank in the body, the core team may close my issue without further explanation or engagement.  All good? Then proceed! -- On several occasions I've experienced that when I leave my computer for a while and come back, all my terminal windows are gone. After some investigation I've reached the conclusion that this happens because the app was installed through the Microsoft store, and just received an update.  This is probably fine for your average note taking app or Candy Crush game, but for a terminal with several tabs open that do actual work (and perhaps even long-running (like several days) processes open in remote SSH sessions) this is completely unacceptable.  Is there a way to avoid the terminal being restarted after receiving an update through the Store? A notification would be fine to let me know that I should restart it on the earliest convenient moment, but having it just disappear can in the worst case scenario cost me days of work that will need to be restarted, and in the best case some inconvenience and a few minutes to get back to where I was before...  Luckily a workaround exists: disable apps auto-updating but is there really no better way of handling this?

Or at the very least that it would notify me that new updates were available, but not install them.  # Actual behavior  Terminal windows suddenly disappear with no explanation whatsoever, before I open the Store app and see that it was just now updated...  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying - right up there with getting to the office in the morning to continue where you left off yesterday, only to find out that the PC rebooted automatically to install Windows updates (hint: not cool)."
not_technical,"Also note, there is a massive difference in these experiences: 1) windows restarts while my console apps are running and all my terminal state is lost AND my enqueued commands for long-running operations to finish while i am sleeping are in an unknown state 2) windows restarts for updates after my enqueued commands finish and all my terminal state is lost 3) windows waits to restart before my enqueued commands finish and restarts terminals with the same windows open 4) windows waits to restart before my enqueued commands finish, and upon restart, terminal relaunches to to the exact same display state 5) windows waits to restart before my enqueued commands finish, and upon restart, terminal relaunches to to the exact same display state including command history  please, on behalf of developers everywhere with long build times, consider moving us more and more to #5 I see that you've mentioned this issue from other closed issues but you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. I was about to open a new report because this issue also doesn't capture the entire story. But instead I'll post some findings here and hope that you can shed some more light on what the plans are.  First, the problem is not just that the console sessions are silently closed when the program automatically updates. I haven't been able to fully trace what set of circumstances causes this, but I've had processes just get orphaned. The only reason I even realize this is that when I go to re-open one of my command line processes, I see that the listening port is still in use and I can't open it. I've then had to go searching through TCPView and Process Explorer to find the orphaned process and kill it.  Second, I tried to circumvent all of this by installing the Terminal app via Chocolatey. However, it still gets updated via the Windows Store!? I'm not sure why that would happen if I did not install via the Store.  At the very least I would  LOVE  an option to disable automatic updates. Another solution might be to tie  all  updates to Terminal to the next Windows reboot cycle? But I think from your comments on other threads this is what you aren't able to do when distributing via the Store.  I would also make the recommendation to just not distribute this application on the Windows Store. This is not really an ideal app for that delivery mechanism. This is a power user / developer targeted app, so I would think it would be distributed more like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, or even Power Toys.  Thanks for your teams work on this app. Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost."
not_technical,"The other way around is also not good. Previously I had a lot of errors in my Event Viewer from Windows Update about the fact that Windows Terminal can't be updated, because the executable is running. We need a better process of updating the app. And it would be nice if we have some kind of configuration options like: automatic restart after update - on/off and so on :) Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior."
not_technical,"because having six copies of an issue is harder on us, and harder to present to our leadership, than one issue with a robust single discussion thread in it? This issue isn't stale insomuch as it has to move at the speed of Windows, rather than the speed of our open-source project. Now: it seems like the discussion here  has  reached its terminus, so there isn't value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. It's on our radar“just as much as it has been since our first update“and we only have as much sway with the store folks as we can get."
not_technical,"I support your reasoning, but a simple model proves that the more folders you have on the PATH, and the more items therein, the more time it takes to search for a specified EXE or DLL.  Of course, the actual measurable impact depends on how much optimization (e.g. caching) has been put into that search algorithm, and of the platform's performance.  And that is context and OS-dependent (the articles you refer to pertain to searches done by the bash shell on Unix, my use case is the Windows APIs that rely on EXE/DLL searches on the PATH).

not_technical,"with this comment, you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be.

not_technical,"we just picked this up and started working on it. Two engineers on the terraform core team recently started working on supporting count, for each, and depends on work in modules.  Modules should be first-class, and the message is really clear from the terraform community that having some language features not work in modules makes it hard to adopt modules as intended, which has downstream consequences like making it harder to write maintainable, well organized terraform code. We saw how many people asked for it, we understand why not having it is painful, have prioritized it, and are actively working on it.  This is one of the terraform core team's current top priorities, and it's also a pretty significant amount of work, more than you'd imagine, because it's part of a larger effort to make modules first-class. The project just started, and I don't have an ETA.  As the project is currently running, it looks like for each and count will be done first, and then depends on will follow afterward. However, it may be that we batch them all up in the same release to minimize churn. Thank you epic update and the transparency is appreciated! I think we can finally all rest easy that this is coming"

Just because it's ""early and incomplete"" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse."
not_technical,"You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. The remaining 1% is barely contained smugness and superiority of someone in a position of some power, and it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ""ban on tabs"" which you mentioned above. So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. I am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet."
not_technical,"You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. But this situation is  worse  when spaces have been inserted.  This is my biggest frustration with this change in behaviour, and there is no way to avoid it.  It's far easier, and far less typing, to manually realign with tabs than with spaces.  To make matters worse, some lines are left alone & some are changed to spaces, so you don't know until you start typing.  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating."
not_technical,"No matter, you've never seen any other existing or previous code editor, since text editors first existed, behave the way VS does. When auto-indenting, it ALWAYS changes TABs between code and line comments to SPACES no matter what settings are selected - like the 'always keep TABs' setting. Nobody asked for this behaviour.  It's a bug. Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. How about not commenting before understanding what you read? I never said Git does anything with spaces and TABs -- I explicitly mentioned line endings."
not_technical,"There is no one consensus on the definition of correct behavior. The overwhelming majority of users are happy with the current implementation of tabs/spaces handling. Accounting for the remaining ones (in particular, this and ""always use tabs"") without breaking the experience for users who are happy with the current behavior is a particularly challenging exercise that requires both design and implementation work.  I'm not sure this will move up on the internal priority list in the near future, but if an external user wanted to spend the time to define and implement the full experience we would be happy to review it. See #23394 for a great example of a feature which shipped because a contributor went through this process. ˜„ How about you take the same approach as Git does for line endings?  1. Replace TABs with spaces on reformat 2. Replace spaces with TABs on reformat 3. Leave both as entered on reformat  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved?  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for (Deity)'s sake!"
not_technical,"I can certainly understand the frustration of **Always keep TABs** not doing what it says on the tin! I truly do want to fix this as we have under-served tabs users in the past and want to ensure it is just a viable and useful as spaces.  Let's talk potential solutions (setting aside for a moment the engineering cost) and see if we can agree on which one would be most helpful. Once we agree on a design, we can evaluate the engineering difficulty of it.  ## Tabs only mode  Simplest solution would be to have an option that means ""if this option is  on  Tabs are never allowed to be converted to spaces by the formatter"". I will tentatively call this  Tabs only mode  (since sadly ""Always"" is taken). I think this will operate like folks want but there is a corner case that has been called out that we need to consider which is what if we can't perfectly align things with just tabs?. So, if you set your tabs to some indenting (like say ""4"") we would try to get you as close as we can based on those settings with the understanding that we could be off by one or more. This would be an example of a worst-case scenario where we could choose to either be off by  one  or  three  when tabs have an indent size of 4.  I think intuitively we would say ""We should be off by as little as possible"". So, for worst case scenarios like the ones above we would choose option 2 over option 1. The question for this mode is can the developer ever actually get into a good state when things are not misaligned in this worst-case? The answer is probably not in this mode. Say I add an additional space in front of from:  The formatting engine will just take it away again as we already have a preference that keeps the spacing here to just one space. You could use spaces at the beginning of the line to align things and they would be left alone: But that is dangerously close to  mixing  tabs and spaces which is the very thing we don't want to do. I think like it's not obvious to me what would be most excellent here. But I am just one guy what do I know? Maybe we try a vote? ## Tabs preferred mode  An alternative would be ""Use spaces as little as possible"" named something like  Tabs preferred mode . In this mode we would use tabs to re-align things and only use spaces iff there was no other means to get things to line up. - **React with  for  Tabs preferred mode ** I apologize for being rude, but ever since Visual Studio 2015 I am sick of Visual Studio messing with my keyboard input and not respecting my configuration choices (and in some situations not even giving me any choice).  I understand that the problems with mixed tabs and spaces such as this very contrived example.  Are really complex to solve, but perhaps it would be prudent not to mess with indentation when mix of tabs and spaces is detected at line start? The rest of the line could be formatted according to the rules, leaving anything past the expression end as-is to avoid messing up comment alignment.  I understand that perfection will never be possible, but at least having an option to disable auto-conversion of tabs to spaces would be a start.  jmarolf Thanks for starting the discussion about potential solutions.  Maybe we are approaching the problem from the wrong angle? Maybe we should instead define rules such as:  - Always use tabs for line indentation, comment alignment. - Use tabs for variable declaration alignment unless they are in the middle of the code. - Always use tabs for right aligning before assignment operator. - Always align if sub-expressions on their opening paren. - Always align left and right side in if comparisons on the operator inside paren, pad left or right side as necessary.  If I am not mistaken the rules such as those would produce the results as in the above contrived example. Again, I understand that it might not be possible to code such rules, but at least it should be possible for me to format the code like that without having to fight with the editor for every character I type."
not_technical,"I don't think this is the case.  For example, i believe we may choose to align things, and not stick with tabs.  But i would have to go check on that. I believe this may be a bug or a feature depending on ones perspective.  I certain see how it can be a bug.  However, that doesn't mean that just because it's a bug that it is simple to fix or that it is without consequences if changes are made here.  Again, as i mentioned above, the existing formatting system is highly complex (including with likely bugs in it that many have taken dependencies on).  So changes need to be very judiciously made."
not_technical,"The preliminary design discussion is now complete. We will review the final user experience once it is ready. I keep hearing people referring to tabs as hard when it's actually the other way around -- tabs are soft (as in you can replace them with any number of spaces on display),, and spaces are hard (as in hard-coded number in the file itself which you can't reformat so easily on display).  That said, I would really prefer if Tab key did what it says on the tin -- inserted a Tab character into the editor. Currently in Visual Studio 16.5.4 that doesn't seem to be the case even though I have configured everything to have Tabs instead of spaces.  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015:  1. Editor trying to be ""smart"" and disregarding user input more and more (i.e. I enter Tab and it enters spaces even though it's clearly configured to use Tabs) 2. Premature code analysis and error checking (i.e. telling you your code is broken and offering to ""fix"" it before you ever get a chance to complete it)  Those additions waste enormous amounts of developer time and effort on fighting them when they are wrong (and sadly they can be wrong a lot). The least you could do is offer an option to disable both behaviors globally.  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts."
not_technical,I didn't.  I said i'd never see such behavior.  I have not.  That was me just giving insight that I wasn't familiar with what you are talking about. I'm happy to clarify any of my points.  Def ask questions and I'll get back to you asap.  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :)
not_technical,"But this situation is  worse  when spaces have been inserted.  This is my biggest frustration with this change in behaviour, and there is no way to avoid it.  It's far easier, and far less typing, to manually realign with tabs than with spaces.  To make matters worse, some lines are left alone & some are changed to spaces, so you don't know until you start typing.  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. I'm not sure i agree.  Spacing allows things like alignment to happen in a very flexible fashion that is independent of whatever tab settings user have.  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :)"
not_technical,"We'll give this a bit of time to cool down. I did try implementing this once in the past, but it was difficult to get the formatter to understand the leading whitespace on a line might contain both hard tabs (indent) and spaces (alignment). Even the simpler option of having a mode to toggle between the current behavior and the pre-Roslyn behavior would be very difficult to implement. Since the formatter applies tab/space conversion in the middle of lines, it's unfortunately not possible to take the ""easy"" approach of limiting a fix to the handling of indentation. The current workaround is to disable the auto-format on type/paste option: Altering the behavior within the formatter is very challenging (combinatorial explosion in the heuristics frequently lead to subtle regressions) so given the behavior is 6 years old with less than 10  votes, it's going to be difficult to prioritize a change. If i've missed any points, i apologize.  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it.  Feel free to point it out once this is unlocked and i'll respond as best as i can. i'm not disregarding this.  I'm just providing some insight that sometimes it's better to just stick with a regression versus introducing multiple regressions at multiple points in time.  i definitely commiserate with the initial regression being unpleasant.  However, with a rewrite the size of roslyn *and* the entire formatting engine being rewritten *from the ground up* it was unfortunately the case that this did happen.  However, now that we have the current system, i would be loathe to potentially have this same thing happen *again*. I totally get that that can be frustrating.  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not.  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups.  As i mentioned in this comment, this code is *the* most complex in the entire codebase for me.  Changes to it are both non-trivial and carry a large amount of risk.  Just a few days ago i discovered something new and unexpected about it for me, and i had to completely give up on a refactoring here because there was a part of this whose behavior was too subtle and complex to fully understand and i had to timebox myself out of it. Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed.  My hope was to try to provide some clarity on the challenges here as this isn't really a case of: ""oh, this is just a bug with a trivial solution"" but rather more like ""this is a potential mine-field that we have to be very careful of"".  Also, as per this comment, i would be happy to continue this discussion in realtime on discord or gitter.  It might be more conducive than here as we can cover a lot more stuff, and we can make sure any particular questions/concerns you have are responded to.  If you are interested, LMK and i'm happy to meet up with you at practically any time.  thanks!"
not_technical,"So, i would need some strong answers to problems i see arising from changing the representation of the file for different developers.  First, that would violate some of our efforts we have around reproducible builds.  Second, it seems like it would just cause problems for normal situations like: Here, the continuation lines need to be indented 9 columns to maintain alignment.  Replacing these with tabs just breaks this.  Even if it was on some tab multiple for some developers, it might not be for others.  In general, I think all developers on the team (including CI) should operate on a bit-for-bit identical version of the code for many important reasons. Let me be absolutely clear that I did not suggest changing Git behavior, but rather emulating their set of options for the particular problem at hand.  With that out of the way, can we agree that VS editor already does some sort of ""normalization"" of TABs and spaces?  The problem in my opinion is twofold:  1. The existing settings that govern TAB .vs. space editor behavior are all over the place and totally do not work as described in the UI, much less produce results that are expected. 2. There is no What You Type Is What You Get editor setting -- I just want (and I am sure I am not the only one) that when I enter mixed TABs and spaces on a single line of code that they stay exactly like I entered them (save for expression reformatting which is already customizable enough for everyone's taste). You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). If you want to keep spaces in your files then rest assured that nobody here wants to take that away from you. I am asking for more options, not less. Therefore, please stop diluting the topic with pointless and/or obvious comments.  So once again, I only want an editor option to not touch beginning of line indentation, variable name indentation, and comment indentation -- it is irrelevant whether those are done with TABs, spaces, or a mixture of the two -- I want it preserved as I typed it.  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options."
not_technical,"Design meeting notes: In the past we've had conflicting requests on the behavior for tabs within a line of code so we need to add an option for this behavior.  My proposal: * add editorconfig setting that enforces tabs within a line of code. tab within line * add new toggle in **Tools  Options  C#  Tabs**: Enforce tabs within lines. * It could also go under **Tools  Options  C#  Code Style  Formatting  Spacing** if that is the preferred place to keep editorconfig settings. Nice proposal to add an extra option. Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? As the current option does reflect what it should do, to ""keep tabs"" and do not replace them with spaces - This is the behavior as I know it from previous versions and as it is within the C++ text editor - I would prefer an new option that says ""keep tabs only for indent"" for this new behavior. One saying ""Enforce tabs within lines"" would still confuse and let me wonder why I have to check that extra option in situations I already selected ""Keep tabs""."
not_technical,"I've never seen git do that. No matter, you've never seen any other existing or previous code editor, since text editors first existed, behave the way VS does.

I'd also like you to spend some time to read my back and forth with Microsoft software engineers there.  You can see everything that needs improvement in the way issues are handled now at Microsoft -- from developer(s) not understanding the issue despite clear explanations, over them trying to find excuses not to change anything, over them not understanding the undelying platform behavior and original Win32 API, over developers of 3rd party libraries and tools chiming in saying issue should be fixed, to the issue resolution being endlessly postponed because ""more discussion is needed"" or ""triage is needed"" or whatever the excuse of the day is. I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. On the contrary -- I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can.  TL,DR -- I did provide feedback, I answered all questions asked, and as far as I am concerned I did more than enough to help you understand the problem we are having and how you might solve it. I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing.  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you.  For everyone else, it's tough, because they **can't turn it off if they choose to**. I'm not suggesting the behaviour is changed with no way for any user to keep their preferred style (which is actually what happened in 2015), just that the user options behave as advertised. The formatting applied from the beginning of the line to code statements  does  follow the selected option - use spaces or tabs. The formatting between code statements and comments does  not  follow the selected option - it always uses spaces. It appears that the user option is ignored in this specific location.  The location and 'tabulation' of the formatting is fine, just the characters used. It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex.  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned."

Humans are creatures of habit and muscle memory is how we free our brain's capacity so it can perform more complex tasks, contextual controls or behavior are breaking muscle memory and are thus bad UI and software design. Again, all I want is that spaces and tabs are left as I entered them when the line is reformatted. Nothing more, nothing less.

All I'm saying is if we put in a bunch of work to restore the pre-2015 behavior or come up with some new behavior that applies one way for all situations, some users will be happy and some users will not.

Again, as i mentioned above, the existing formatting system is highly complex (including with likely bugs in it that many have taken dependencies on).  So changes need to be very judiciously made. That's quite possible.  My guess is that it happened when we did the entire roslyn rewrite.  We tried to preserve a lot of old behavior, but we very likely did not given the huge complexity in the old system and that the new system takes an entirely different approach on things.  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/   It's a tricky situation to be sure!"
not_technical,"Yes.  That's always a possibility.  It's happened numerous times in the past with many requests from many customers.  It's always something that needs to be kept in mind.  Furthermore, it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar.  So navigating all the potential requests and constraints here can be tricky and takes a lot of communication and a lot of thought.  Thanks! :) Then just concentrate on the **original problem in the first post**.  It's a very straightforward problem. **Tab characters, between code and double-slashed comments, are changed to space characters when auto-indenting is performed.** Auto indenting works fine - it uses TAB characters when asked, but TAB characters after the code are changed. Why? This is with **Always keep TABs** option selected. If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? This behaviour does not exist in older versions of VS.  At some point it has been added by someone, for some reason. That was the point at which the user experience was broken."
not_technical,"Can you file a separate issue for that? Disabling a diagnostic is expected to disable a diagnostic. There is already an issue for IDE0055 about it fighting vertical alignment (i.e. replacing tabs with spaces as I showed above). It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. I am not even going to mention the one I reported in .Net Environmet namespace two years ago.  Do you honestly believe that opening another issue will help? At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because ""it's complicated"")."
not_technical,"We do fix hundreds of issues.  But there are a lot of things out there that people want fixed.  So it's definitely possible that the set you care about isn't the set that always makes it into a release.   The ones in this area are particularly thorny, and we lack a good mechanism to get high confidence that changes here not only make things better for these cases, but also do not make things worse for cases that others care about. This is really worse, what I read here. This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. Most of this reports were closed after a short period. I am quite sure, that everyone here knows about the license costs - I use a lot of cheaper software where the companies do not deal in such a bad way with their customers and fix such bugs when they get reported. Funny enough that this is open, the one reported on VS2017 Express. You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. This is not understandable, a new engine has bugs and you do not feel the need to get it fixed? On top it is for the comfort in code editing and this is a bug that breaks the comfort in editing, creates unnecessary extra work “ a very worse experience. How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? I still remember that there once was really good bug handling within the visual studio team - seems that this is history."

This is still a problem.  The older versions of editors never used to behave like this.  Other editors don't behave like this.  Even Notepad doesn't behave like this. I'll explain simply: With the option to KEEP TABS selected in the Editor settings, TABs typed within code (so end of line comments line up, for example.) are later changed into spaces by Visual Studio.  When copying & pasting a line, for example. I NEVER want this to happen.  That's why I select the option to KEEP TABS. If I type a TAB in my code, I NEVER want it changed it to spaces.  It's really that simple.  Why is this not fixed after 2+ years? This is not an enhancement request, but simply a request that the editor behave as editors have always behaved since the dawn of computing.  At some point, someone in Microsoft decided to 'muck' around with users typed code and change it, when not one user asked for that to happen.    Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent?  Yes, it's actually a primary request for users who indent with tabs. That's simply not true.  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS.  Also worth noting that this still happens when the 'Use Adaptive Formatting' option is turned off.  So it is impossible to prevent this from happening."
not_technical,"For 75% of my career to date, I was a non-Microsoft developer working on projects primarily using tabs for indentation. The current behavior better represented the expected behavior for those projects, so on those projects I would have considered VS2015 to be the point where the bug was  fixed , not introduced (note that I was not working at Microsoft for the VS2015 release where this behavior changed, so I was just a user). The complexity here is we're not talking about ""fixing a bug"", we're talking about introducing an option at a location that was never designed to be an option, and somehow getting both behaviors to work seamlessly. This is a simplification, because in reality there are  at least  three very different behaviors being requested. What 'bug' are you talking about? Please read the initial post again, and please stick to one topic per thread. There is nothing complex about the BUG he is reporting.  If that  is  what you are talking about, then please demonstrate another editor in existence which replaces tabs with spaces between code and comments.  That is NOT expected behaviour. If you are talking about something different then please split this thread as several quite different topics appear to be being discussed at once.  Nothing will get fixed that way."
not_technical,"So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? Well I know one thing for certain -- I do not want an AI or any piece of software to ""think"" instead of me and attempt to interpret my consistent keyboard input in different ways at different times as it pleases. Humans are creatures of habit and muscle memory is how we free our brain's capacity so it can perform more complex tasks, contextual controls or behavior are breaking muscle memory and are thus bad UI and software design. Again, all I want is that spaces and tabs are left as I entered them when the line is reformatted. Nothing more, nothing less. All existing indentation and spacing formatting was fine for me before this ""smart"" tab to space conversion on reformat was added. I just want an option to turn it off. How hard can that be? Yes.  That's always a possibility.  It's happened numerous times in the past with many requests from many customers.  It's always something that needs to be kept in mind.  Furthermore, it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar.  So navigating all the potential requests and constraints here can be tricky and takes a lot of communication and a lot of thought.  Thanks! :)"
not_technical,"Oh, i've never found that to be the case myself.  This is why i always use spaces.  I can perfectly realign on any column effectively with spaces.  Ymmv of course :D Agreed.  This is one reason i ban tabs in all codebases i control.  It's just far too unpredictable across all scenarios (esp. when working with multiple tools).  I get that may not be palatable for your own preferences though of course :-/ You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs."

not_technical,"Flutter team itself said that they considered the option to go with OpenGL and Metal, but they didn't. They decided to go with Metal only.

not_technical,"from my understanding the shaders we are talking of don't get there source dynamically or are they? So you wouldn't even need to cache them you could directly bundle the precompiled metal shaders. In contrary to OpenGL you always know that the metal API will be there. Anyone else has opinion that cashing is just a crutch? Looks like, it is just attempt to run away from the problem and try to hide it.  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch?  All application on flutter just lagging, even Google applications, everyone understand that cashing would probably decrease lagging, but not remove them all.

not_technical,"IS4 will work until 2022 at that point you won't able to get security fixes, etc.  They went enterprise pricing, there is no hobby pricing or ""starter"".   They went from 0 to 60.  It's ok, it's their choice, but we have a choice too.  Before we migrate to one of the other FOSS systems we're waiting for Microsofts response to this.  Surely this is a pivot moment to solve this internally  for the framework.  MVC1-5 came with auth solutions so I expect they will continue that tradition.  Json parsing used require 3rd party (at least if you wanted performance).  That's internal now and far better.  We'll see what they do. A full OpenID Provider has been built in.  Not sure why it's considered necessary to have it now. I get that IdentityServer going non-free sucks for some users but there are alternatives like OpenIDdict. Begging Microsoft to make things like this distracts them from improving core functionality.  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet."
not_technical,"In fact you have until end of 2022 to move over. That's two years. As he says, pricing a product is hard. If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. Please contact us directly. thanks!"

not_technical,"Most of full stack framework out there has official package for crucial things like this (say laravel). Coming from other communities like php, node, etc, dev can build and experiment with everything totally free. This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially. Edit: and yes its totally up to the creators if that's their decision Having sustainable OSS projects  is  part of a healthy ecosystem. If not 1500, what amount would you pay? If the answer is ""none"" then  you're the problem ."
not_technical,"We have 2020 and those features should be something that should be absolutely solved **in a standardized way** and freely available in a famework: - Access token creation with including custom claims - Refreshtoken creation and presistence - Everything needs to be easily scalable to multiple instances. - Storage of credentials should be easily customizable.  Again, the point here is that we invested time and money in solutions using IS for those things. Because MS said this is the way to go. We are still in a crucial situation with .net and hoping that it gain more ppl using it. Also if Blazor should gain traction something like this just doesn't help. I agree with everything you said  this is a pretty core function to the Microsoft Stack, had they done it right in the first place it would have never been issue today. Also he is out of line with personal comments like that. What an idiot, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. Why is this closed?!"
not_technical,"We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** If you've been using IdentityServer all this time, you've already been depending on a 3rd party company. OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free - either roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. If you can't afford 1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business."
not_technical,"That's great feedback - exactly what the Duente dudes need to hear in order to get their pricing right Is this really so basic? If it's such a simple thing to do, Brock and Dominick wouldn't be able to create such a product - and you wouldn't be so disappointed at the move to a commercial model, you'd simply roll your own, or fork IS4 and continue from there.  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise."
not_technical,"I get it that the creators need money so it is their decision whatever they want to do.  For the .net ecosystem it is a rather disastrous event. As a small company that has chosen IdentityServer because it is the ""official"" framework of choice, both according to Microsoft and the general community, you are now facing a lot of not needed and not wanted problems. Sure you can say, yes 1500 is not much in the business environment. But this is not true for all of them. For us it is a lot of money and also a lot of time that we have already invested. We now have to migrate to something different. In a healthy ecosystem, it should not happen that a pillar on which so many have built, changes the license so negatively.  Yes, open source is not about ""free work"" but you clearly want to have a .net ecosystem with all the basic tools that keep steady and have a very open license. It would have been better if they did the license change back then when they converted IdentityServer to .net core. Most of full stack framework out there has official package for crucial things like this (say laravel). Coming from other communities like php, node, etc, dev can build and experiment with everything totally free. This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially. Edit: and yes its totally up to the creators if that's their decision"
not_technical,"Here are some alternatives that may have come to pass without this move :  1. They stop developing identity server completely as it's not financially viable for them to continue it. 2. Support and ongoing changes dry up. You have a live issue and there's no one to help you out. Also consider the difference now : The team may have more funds to invest in making the API and docs even better, saving you time and money. In other words, positioning this as a negative move is perhaps a little short sighted. The current situation was probably unsustainable and this was no surprise to me when I saw the news. You have until the end of life of netcore 31 which is next year, to plan for a migration strategy. As I understand it, IS4 will continue to work, it's simply not going to be updated. I suspect that the time saving of paying the money will outweigh the cost of moving but you will undoubtedly know better.

Coming from other communities like php, node, etc, dev can build and experiment with everything totally free.

not_technical,"Totally true, identity and access management should be baked into the framework as it is needed in almost any serious app. Sorry, but this is just an arrogant statement by you. I absolutely don't want to pay anything extra (yearly!!) for such a **very basic** thing like identity in my framework. Again, I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. But I (and a lot of other not so high profile devs like you) invested a lot of time into using this product since MS declared it the defacto standard. I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180. This is an absolutely not planned change that cost a lot of time and money. If this was a framework that helps solving some black magic math issues, I wouldn't have such problems. But we absolutely need fully FOSS solutions for the very basic things in every day life. And I don't agree that MS should't fill this gap here. It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever**."
not_technical,"I don't see why this is a big deal - still fine for ASP.NET Core to ship OSS templates that include IdentityServer4 under this license. If companies want great tools for solving problems as complicated and critical as identity management they should have no problem paying for it. We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL**"
not_technical,"Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... we'll make an announcement when ready"
not_technical,"you realize that's a commit graph, right? That has everything to do with the amount of code changes being committed and none to do with how often the project is adopted by end-users? Plus those code changes are overwhelmingly committed by the two original maintainers of the project. Then again, I'm not surprised users with blank Github profiles might be confused by how OSS is actually produced. Bringing this back to ASP.NET Core -  Identity  is already built-in. As poke explained very well:  IdentityServer is only tangentially related to Identity management. It's an identity provider which is still a special thing you likely don't want to put into every other app. Identity management itself is built into the framework with ASP.NET Identity. That is completely unrelated to what IdentityServer offers though except that it integrates well into ASP.NET Identity. Other platforms actually often don't have solutions like IdentityServer, especially not built-in. A common alternative that I know of is Keycloak (which you can easily use for your .NET apps as well).  If the issue at-hand here is that now you have to migrate IS to something else, guess what:  1. You can keep using IS4,  supported by the IS team on Github , up until Dec 31 2022, for free. 2. After that...  you can still keep using it , but they're not going to be patching bugs for free anymore. 3. So in the event that you really do run into a critical problem, you can fork IS4 and patch it yourself if needed. We're done here and I'm locking the issue. Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. After all, one of the reasons we went with Identity Server in the first place was the community reaction to our suggestion we produced a simple authorization service, and the loud and clear message we shouldn't try to reinvent something that already had a good open source solution.  Once .NET 5 is done and dusted I'm sure we'll have senior msft folks come up with an appropriate venue for a wider discussion over some of the issues. I will remind all of you we have a code of conduct."

The following is extremely inconvenient: 1. you can't highlight in terminal 2. shortcut like shift+left arrow which is used to highlight produces characters ,2D (see picture) 3. breaking from a loop using Ctrl+C sometimes exits Python, you have to invoke all over again. 4. The big fat cursor is ugly.  Essentially, The Python extension just invokes Python from terminal. I mean, if I wanted the terminal experience, I'd do it with VIM.

Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...).  I can understand that you don't have time to do SUI technical stuff, and I can understand your desire to make SUI a web standard and a long goal life.

not_technical,"understood. The one thing we need from you and levithomason, DESPERATELY, is hopefully less than 20 minutes of your time to give 2 actively trusted people the power to add and remove privileged maintainers within this project and ideally within this organization. They should also have the power to add more administrators like themselves if needed. (Most privileged maintainers should not have such extra administrator power.)  I think this one action would be a MAJOR TECHNICAL LIFESAVER: - prevent the otherwise inevitable project fork that is under discussion here, #6413, and #6109, among other places - keep this project at the existing quality level - avoid the dead project syndrome  By ""project fork"" I mean a significant portion of the team split off, like what happened with node.js in the past. I think it would be much better to keep this project as one united team if possible.  I would like to commend you for the major efforts it must have taken on your part to get this project this far. I think we all understand 100% that you must be completely swamped with your professional work, business work for the project, and personal obligations. I remain extremely hopeful that you can help the rest of us with the one action proposed here. The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. I want to see this project live, and if forking it is the only way to get maintainers that then I'm behind it... You have good intentions for your project, and want to see it succeed. However, it's being smothered by inactivity and the inability of other members to step in.  The dead project syndrome is already rearing it's head when pull requests to fix bugs are being auto-closed due to inactivity... I see new bug reports and KNOW that I can fix it, but why bother if it's for naught and the fix gets ignored. **I love Semantic UI**, and if this project where to come back to life would happily set aside a dedicated amount of time to find and fix issues on a regular basis. I've stopped paying attention to the project over the last year, and even explored other UI libraries because it no longer seems to be moving forward.  It's at a critical point now, other passionate members are literally begging for the ability to maintain a project they love. I'm sure they want to avoid a fork, we need active maintainers that can keep this project running while you are sorting out funding. There are even members trying to maintain their own forks/versions."
not_technical,"And, thank you, and Microsoft, for making it so easy to both gather and look at perf recordings. It is a game changer for me! Ahhhh! Yeah, you're getting hit by the known issue! Anyone else seeing this, you'll likely see perf return to normal if you keep scaling <= 200% and your font <24pt., though not guarantees.  I found the dev owner yesterday and he was literally working on fix for this issue that surfaced elsewhere but is the same root cause!  Re. XPerf/WPA - **I KNOW, RIGHT**!!

not_technical,"Resolution 3840x2160. Scaling 250. Both the recommended setup.  I have tried different fonts but have not stumbled upon any that worked, but have not on the other hand made exhaustive tests. Consolas is affected, as is Deja Vu Sans Mono for PowerLine, and several other PowerLine fonts.  Wow! Setting the resolution scaling to 200% improves perf  a lot. And, thank you, and Microsoft, for making it so easy to both gather and look at perf recordings. It is a game changer for me!"
not_technical,"Alright gentlemen, enough with the pissing contest :) I think the answer is clear: bitcrazed explained above that the glyph rendering is being done by GDI/GDI+, an ancient CPU-bound renderer with its roots in the original NT. Yes, there was hardware acceleration added during the win7/2008r2 era, but clearly this isn't enough anymore. The technological successors to GDI and GDI+ are Direct2D and DirectWrite (mentioned above), which also arrived with win7/2008r2. Whenever this renderer upgrade will happen, who knows... Are you suggesting that some other, faster and more modern renderer was used in Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1? Because in those OSes everything is still working as intended (i.e. the console application is not being slowed down more than 25 times). Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really ""yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows""? That's a rhetorical question, don't bother."
not_technical,"Yes! Thank goodness for progress, and randomascii, for his incredibly helpful blog posts on analysing the data. Learned so much from him! Huge props! I'm always glad to hear when my blog posts are useful."
not_technical,"We are looking into this. Sorry for the delay - Build prep is eating up a lot of people x hours right now ,) powercode - Okay, we have some suspicions as to what's happening here (thanks CD for your help with this ˜)  Could we ask: 1. What is the size & resolution of your screen?  15.6""  3200 x 1800? 1. What DPI scaling factor are you using? 1. What is the font face & size of your affected Console(s)? 1. Does this problem disappear if you decrease your Console font size to ~12pt when running at 200% DPI?  BTW - MANY thanks for capturing traces - they've been ENORMOUSLY helpful!"
not_technical,"I know it always seems like a fine and dandy idea to say ""hey we're going to break back-compat for thousands of existing apps so we can add some new features for people"" but we like to hold ourselves to a higher standard than that. We've found a path where we can do good for all of the existing users of the console codebase, and slowly introduce new features and modernize, without leaving customers behind.  Sure, we could have deprecated the old console and parked the console subsystem and implemented a new PTY subsystem. That's a path we could have taken, but that would have left everyone with an existing console application asking ""why did Microsoft deprecate their entire console API with no plan to modernize those existing apps? Are they *fools*?""  We're just now in a place where the console subsystem *can* support conpty, where it can support other rendering heads, and where the backing buffer could possibly support emoji and other unicode codepoints. It might not be the path that makes *you* the most happy, but it's the path that makes the most developers the most happy.  We're working on a new rendering head. No commitments as to when it'll be finished, but we're working on it. When it's done, then that will likely resolve the performance issues described in this thread. I haven't personally debugged into this issue, but my gut agrees with Rich's analysis that the issue is coming from GDI. I certainly wouldn't call this a major perf regression, and I doubt it's due to any of our code in particular. It's likely just due to a really old CPU-bound graphics API that's not optimized for running on new hardware.  As warrenrumak mentioned, if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. They have.  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical ""twenty year old stuff"" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)."

As warrenrumak mentioned, if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior. This rule is simply assuming it owns the entire namespace of all functions beginning with ""use"", and starts screaming about unrelated functions in the rest of the project that have nothing to do with React.  This is much more atrocious than carelessly declaring variables in the global namespace! Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with ""use"". Not all of us are React developers and we shouldn't have to change code in unrelated parts of the application.  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build."
not_technical,"The console is a very polarizing Windows component--everybody has an opinion on how we should run the team, where we should make our investments, and what we should put on our roadmap. We can't do  everything , but we also can't do  nothing  and remain technologically relevant in 2018. The v1/legacy console is representative of this polarization. Please bear with us as we try to improve the state of the art for everybody.  As always, thanks for reporting this. We'll definitely be triaging this with the rest of our bug fixes. In the meantime, however, please keep the discourse civil. When outputting text from PowerShell on a Dell XPS 15, the rendering speed is amazingly slow. I have not come across this on any other machine.  Attached a short windows performance recording of this. conhost.exe (1608) and pwsh.exe (19432) are the relevant processes. Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on."

not_technical,"As a workaround, add overloads to Array.isArray() using declaration merging? Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective.  Humans are much better at figuring these things out than computers.  In the *general case*, the compiler can't safely deduce that Generic1<number ” Generic2 number unless both are in the union to be narrowed, because the type parameter might be used for different purposes in both types. would likely suffice.  I suspect this is probably how Flow does it."

In that issue (Array.isArray and ReadOnlyArray<T), it seemed like the preference from people was that narrowing.  It'd be confusing if string | Iterable<number narrowed to Iterable<number but narrowing Iterable<number produced Array<number - the isArray type guard should uniformly either produce a subtype or filter a union, not do one or the other depending on whether the argument type has some unrelated (e.g. known-false-returning) union constituents.

The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a ""cozy""/""wintery"" thing is very offensive to me. I come from Norway and people who glorify snow is equivalent to the people who glorified hitler during WW2. The amount of deaths caused by winter is massive, not to mention the depression the season brings and you want to bring that into my work space as well? This is unacceptable, everytime I leave my house I see snow and I want to escape into Visual Studio Code and get some work done and what do I see? More snow... To me this is equally offensive as a swastika. This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that.

not_technical, This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games.
not_technical,"I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is  white  and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! Also I think climate calculations are wrong and new ice age is nearby. There will be more snow. Thank you global warming fighters, for helping to make even more snow!"
not_technical,"Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. You are not the center of the universe.

You also act as if I had any control of what contributors work on. This is an open source project, contributors work on what they want, when they want. It's not a company where I pay them to work for me and they do what I order them to.

not_technical,"you come off as quite hostile.

I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short  right back at you then. since there is no ""leadership"" in this open source project, you sir, cannot claim C# is superior to gdscript then. i just gave you two god damn good reasons why gdscript  C#, and you still continue to dodge. gg faker.  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not ""low level enough"", but then go around merging PRs for ""emoji smiley"" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??   websocket support still has never been implemented. are you going to pay Faless a quarter of the 20,000 grant that mozilla gave? since he actually implemented the websocket module? or you going to say ""ahhh, software conservancy handles the funds, we don't know what to do with it!"" as you always do? then keep it for akien, you, and karroffel? doesn't really seem fair to me.  look at it from my perspective please.  in any event. complete and utter crap. but wait, akien-mga will continue to block users, close discussions, etc. seems like i need to go make a new fucking account again for the 5th time... can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! so much for ""open source""."
not_technical,"This went out of hands. There is not a drop of constructive criticism here, only very hostile behavior and personal attacks.

Stop shilling for  from software conservancy"
not_technical,"c# was the biggest mistake i've ever witnessed in godot. name me, one god damn reason why a developer would favour C# over Godot's GDScript? for the godot engine?  what you will say is, ohh but mahh c# sharp unity users! it will help bring people from unity over! then, on the other hand, everyone says ""we're not competing against unity!"". yeah, that's horse shit.  second reason: ""ohhh the performance is so much better!"". oh yeah? what are the use cases to back that up? 1% of the godot users having performance issues with gdscript? i doubt it. if a developer is having a performance issue with gdscript, they'd use fucking gdnative.  look through all the **contributors** in those issues. 80% of them have participated in adding other helpful features to Godot too, not just C# stuff. this means, by nature their time is **inherently being focused** on c#.  oh yeah, and here's another problem with this entire ""only implement low level features"" stuff. want to tell me then, why **smiley emojis were added to the core of the engine** then? surely that's not low level is it? but when i suggest **that an inventory system** and other 2d features be added, you spit in my  face and tell me ""it's not low level!"".  meter la mula, cotoco.

not_technical,"Yeah, that's the problem: I don't want to hardcode the path with permalinks, I just want to be able to adjust the file extension... Also: It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved,"
not_technical,"As a soon-to-be user of the leveldb Windows support (for Mesos), here are are my thoughts: For us, C++11 is fine, we already target this. This is an annoying problem, I had to fix this for Mesos. I went with: It also leads into long path issues on Windows. I took an approach similar to the one CMake took for their Windows port, a longpath helper to translate all paths as they reach WinAPI functions from UTF-8 to UTF-16 with ?\ prepended if necessary. My helper is here (note that the max path is  not  255 despite documentation).  I need to stress: native long path support is probably a must for most Windows projects nowadays. It's not terribly difficult to do, it's just  really annoying . Also, for your comment: I'm not sure I entirely agree, there is no data loss going from UTF-8 to UTF-16. Both encodings are  Unicode , it's just an implementation difference. Plus, you can do the conversion natively in C++11. Anyway, I've not had any problems on Windows having gone this route so far.  Thanks for your work! I personally know the trouble it is Also: Yay, a million times, yay! We'll pull it into Mesos with ExternalProject Add."
not_technical,Any further discussion on this topic will need to go to gitter or discord.  Thank you. And I still don't understand why you try to push us into a chat channel that could have random topic float around together all the times and idea would be scattered while discussing here is on the problem itself and categorized on the topic  And not only I don't like decision you made. The reasoning of the rejected are not understandable. Why you can conclude that it would have minimal usage? What is the scenario you had in mind?
not_technical,"This is as unreasonable as the reasoning about minimal usage. Now you don't even have reason why discussion should be there Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise.  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to.  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old.  Please stop. You've been given advice on how to continue. Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times..."
not_technical,We did.  That was part of our decision making process.  But we rejected this proposal as we didn't think it was the right direction for the language. I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ...
not_technical,"The language direction is not decided by polls.  It has a design group that has total control over the design process here.  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 'annoying' was not part of the decision making process.  We genuinely do not believe this is a good feature to add to C# at this point in the lifecycle of the language. It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings  The features we decide on the for the language are not chosen based solely on their technical terms. Yes, that feeds into our decision making.  We are aware of what would be enabled by this, and we made a determination if this would be an overall positive for the language.  We decided it would not be, so we rejected the feature."

(((((((((((( I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed ((((((((((((((((((
not_technical,"as above: if you'd like to discuss this further you can do so at gitter or discord  This language feature has already been decided upon.  The disappointment of people was factored into the decision making process here.  We assessed the pros and cons of this and determined this was not something we felt was valuable enough to make it int the language. Reading LDM and then I still don't think it was the right direction of decision. I don't think we need to care about BCL at all  The first thing we would do with top level function is naked Main. Everyone will start using that. And then every function for using with Main until we really need to use class or struct. At least it would be shared in the same assembly or namespace. It would never be minimal usage at all because everyone will start using it from the start of the project. It make prototyping faster  If there is any concern about collision I think it would be the same as introducing new function in static class then use static using. If that was not the concern this also should be none  As I was proposing. We can treat this feature as just automatic assuming default namespace and default class name of the assembly and just transpile at the compile time  Actually, this feature real usage are most likely internal function so it just add convenience to development time. But we are less likely expose it, we would always have using and using static for that. So it should not concern about BCL at all  I think this would be another wrong decision as generic from C# 1. You underestimate our real usage"
not_technical,"I think, being more specific about- - advantages (for beginners, pros and certain use-cases) - disadvantages (similarly for beginner, pros and certain use-cases) - challenges (of implementation and adaptation)  of a feature will help everyone to agree about whether to go with it or not. And rejecting a proposal with a label likely never is not same as ""not going to do this now"".  More **measurable and mechanical** the decision making process is, more agreement it will generate. At the end, we have to go with the decision makers. But an enthusiastic community is a great asset for a language and ecosystem. People should want to be in it, not have to be with it. The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion.  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. The decision has been made on this issue. The reasoning has been explained.  If you want to start a different discussion on how the language is designed, feel free. However, it will remain off topic on this issue."

I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us), due to the two reasons:  First reason, criticizing people (like what you did) and assuming that they are novice in Python so they don't know how to work with scikit-learn, means you or the staff are trying to blind their eyes to the truth that scikit-learn staff are not able to create a clear tutorial to allow loading the real data, at least. In addition, pretending that the tutorial of scikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the real data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to the real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that scikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.  Second, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you already forgot that  scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are customers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of us and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way of behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If you are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help, don't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely rather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to do that, so keep quite.  On the other hand, regarding the question ""should we instead add as a section in the tutorial here?"", I would like to say "" YES "", you or scikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how to load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are interested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be considered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user, then what is your work? *  Nevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would like to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned previously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this reason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some tools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance,  Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), last version is  WEKA 3-7-13, is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA allows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its very easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent tool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or vice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process manually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you can design a very nice flow to achieve your target.  Thanks David van Leeuwen for your support."
not_technical,"The motivation here is to come up with a single dialect where you wouldn't have to think about the environment regardless to proficiency or task, people who just want/need to write a ""simple program"" and run it shouldn't use a different tool just because now they want to define a top-level function or whatever but for beginners this might be a show stopper especially for new programmers with no prior knowledge and this barrier is a language concern because there are two different dialects and two different tools for the same language. With all due respect your comment makes zero sense here."
not_technical,"I disagree with you on this in the current context.  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug.  Just google ""visual studio c# turn off align comments"" to see. It is a ""minor issue"" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a ""minor issue"" in that it is indeed super annoying. And if they fix this and this do not fix another because they focused here, are they then neglecting the users affected by those other issues? Framing the decision to prioritize bug fixing in a way you don't like as 'neglect' is not helpful. Any project will have bugs and every team will fix using a system that will not align with the desires of all members of their user base. And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it."
not_technical,"Many issues like that are fixed in any given release. You can just look at the issues closed with merged PRs over a certain time period.  That doesn't mean all the things you care about will be addressed though. I've already offered my time toward helping you fix this in a paired manner.  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as ""inaction"" then that's on you. If that changes in the future, let me know.  Still happy to help you out here to reach a resolution you would like! :) I agree!  It's surprising to see that you (or I) were forced to say that explicitly, despite how obvious and self-explanatory it is.  It shouldn't be necessary for you or I to say that, but it was necessary, therefore it raises the question:  What on earth is going on here?   Something is wrong here.  Being an app developer (or likewise) is already a challenging, time-consuming, and exhausting job.  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do  even more  work in the form of  unpaid  casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job.  Such a workload would learn to burn-out (a very significant mental health issue with serious effects).  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior.  He wrote: ... I'm one of those people and have contributed as an external community member a large number of times. ...  Wow. If you wish to sacrifice yourself, then you have the right to do that -- that's your decision for your life.  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect ChainReactive to sacrifice himself like you do.  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft."
not_technical,"When it comes to this area, they may not be.  Hence why I was offering to work through it with you.  Two minds being better than one and all that :) Cheers and good luck!

not_technical,"I'm not sure what else can be stated at this point.  The team has put forth their position on this issue and how it is currently prioritized (i.e. in the help-wanted bucket).  I'm available to help out if you, or anyone else, is interested in tackling this from the community.  As a FOSS project, Roslyn thrives on shared efforts by dedicated teams at MS, outside of MS and from community efforts.  It's part and parcel of that that not all work is done internally.  There is effectively interest from many thousands of individuals and groups about what is important, and the way Roslyn effectively manages that is to make it so that the core team itself is not the limiting factor for improvements happening.  This is a virtue of the project, and one of the very specific reasons it is open source.  At this point, i don't think I can add any more help here.  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome, and the discussion seems to not be providing any actual value toward solving the originally reported issue. If anyone is interested in solving this issue in the future, see the links provided above for a large group of community members (internal and external) and resources that can help out here.Thanks all! I was talking about the Microsoft team's inaction on this bug, not yours.  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction.  To be clear, I think that contributing to open source is a wonderful and worthy endeavor.  We need more of that sort of collaboration in society.  But as verelpode pointed out, we all have a finite amount of time and other priorities in life.  When it comes to side projects, we have to be selective about what we say yes to.  We might have time to contribute to some but not others.  I think it's unreasonable to say that, because I'm a Visual Studio user and want a bug fixed, I must go down the rabbit hole of learning Roslyn.  While I appreciate your offer of assistance, I fail to grasp the practical value of it.  We're all programmers here.  If I'd go to the trouble of learning Roslyn then , for such a small improvement, I may as well figure it out myself.  If you sincerely want to help, rather than just pay lip service to the concept of helping, then please just fix this bug."
not_technical,"Then don't.  Nothing about what i've said insists that you do this.  It merely offers you the choice of doing this.  It's not unethical to make ones time available to help people freely if they are interested.  I do this in many avenues in life.  I freely offer tutoring for many different subjects.  I freely offer assistance with learning different programming languages.  I freely offer time and information toward contributing to some FOSS projects. So you're saying *i'm* operating unethically for offering my time and knowledge to people who may want it because if *you* were to take me up on it it would hurt you?  Does that not strike you as ridiculous?  Should i also not offer free tutoring for interested students because if some were to take it they might be negatively impacted in other avenues of life? Does it not make more sense (and seem more ethical) to have this be available and to leave it entirely to you (and others) to decide if you want to take it or not?  I don't see how this is at all a religion, but i certainly can see how it's a philosophy.  And it's a philosophy that has worked well for dozens of people out there.  I think it's a good thing that I can help out, and I'll continue to do so and will continue to announce this possibility so that if there are people out there (even if its not you) will know and can take advantage of it if they wish.

As a FOSS project, Roslyn thrives on shared efforts by dedicated teams at MS, outside of MS and from community efforts.  It's part and parcel of that that not all work is done internally.  There is effectively interest from many thousands of individuals and groups about what is important, and the way Roslyn effectively manages that is to make it so that the core team itself is not the limiting factor for improvements happening.  This is a virtue of the project, and one of the very specific reasons it is open source.  At this point, i don't think I can add any more help here.  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome, and the discussion seems to not be providing any actual value toward solving the originally reported issue. If anyone is interested in solving this issue in the future, see the links provided above for a large group of community members (internal and external) and resources that can help out here.Thanks all!"
not_technical,"And if they fix this and this do not fix another because they focused here, are they then neglecting the users affected by those other issues? Framing the decision to prioritize bug fixing in a way you don't like as 'neglect' is not helpful. Any project will have bugs and every team will fix using a system that will not align with the desires of all members of their user base. And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. I'm sure they're working on new and great things, but some house keeping of low hanging but high value fruit like this issue would be nice.  I'm sure there are other such issues that they quickly could pick off right in a row, and I wish they would. You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you.  You have a knack for justifying inaction. As I mentioned above, I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least."
not_technical,"That's an interesting pattern observation, but I think you'd like to see this issue fixed and terminated forever, but I fear that if the solution relies upon whether or not that particular space character exists, then it will be precarious and this issue will in future again be reported as a bug, instead of being laid to rest permanently.  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window?  Another case to remember is **mixed** comment types, such as the following example.  The solution for mixed comments appears to be simple and unambiguous and does not require an option in the Options window.  If the second comment is a different type than the first comment, then the second comment should **never** be indented to match the first comment, thus VS should never produce the following: If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution, and I thought about  maybe  making VS look for a tab character in the place marked with ""\t"" following. On my computer, I have Options - Text Editor - C# - Tabs set to ""Keep tabs"".  I can't stand the ""Insert spaces"" option.  I always use tab in-between "","" and "" comment"".  Despite the fact that I have VS set to ""Keep tabs"", when I copy & paste a line or otherwise trigger VS to format the line, VS changes my tabs to spaces.  I wish it wouldn't do that.  I write it with tabs like this...and VS 2019 changes my tabs to spaces against my wishes:"
not_technical,"Visual Studio is a commercial product with a dedicated team on staff at Microsoft.  I'm not already familiar with Roslyn, nor do I have time to dive down that rabbit hole.  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. It's also an open source project with a community that actively contributes to it and provides PRs when their needs don't align with the priorities of the main team itself.  I'm one of those people and have contributed as an external community member a large number of times. As i've already pointed out, the stated view of the team is that there is an easy workaround if hte current behavior is undesirable to you.  If that workaround is not tenable and you want to see this fixed, it will have to come from a PR from someone willing to view the change as valuable enough to invest their own time. I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience. As an open source project, ""the people"" includes the community (including you, me, and other interested parties). Yes, that's likely true.  But they're also tasked with work felt to be more important and a more valuable use of their time.  And so here we are."
not_technical,"I agree!  It's surprising to see that you (or I) were forced to say that explicitly, despite how obvious and self-explanatory it is.  It shouldn't be necessary for you or I to say that, but it was necessary, therefore it raises the question:  What on earth is going on here?   Something is wrong here.  Being an app developer (or likewise) is already a challenging, time-consuming, and exhausting job.  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do  even more  work in the form of  unpaid  casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job.  Such a workload would learn to burn-out (a very significant mental health issue with serious effects).  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior.  He wrote: ... I'm one of those people and have contributed as an external community member a large number of times. ...  Wow. If you wish to sacrifice yourself, then you have the right to do that -- that's your decision for your life.  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect ChainReactive to sacrifice himself like you do.  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. It's unethical to provide support to people to show how they can contribute to the Roslyn open source project? This is how much of the open source world works.  Projects are made freely available for people to use and modify and contribute back to.  When the priorities of the team don't align with your particular desires, you can choose to petition that they change, and/or you can choose to contribute your own efforts to align the project with your own desires. I have never expected ChainReactive to do anything. I have simply pointed out that this is something he can choose to contribute to if he wishes.  And, if he does wish to do so, i am 100% willing to provide my own time and experience toward aiding that effort.  There are many other community members who are willing to do that as well, and this has led to hundreds of community PRs and thousands of commits to the Roslyn repo that have improved the project for *everyone*.  This is the power and value of it being an open source project."

not_technical,"I'd welcome your assistance in making up for Microsoft's negligence.  As I've already mentioned, I don't have time to get into Roslyn.  How about I send you my kudos once you fix this bug?  But if your Roslyn skills aren't up to stuff, then don't worry about it. Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence.  There are millions of users and thousands of signals indicating what is valuable and important to actually address with the resources available.  This minor issue simply isn't one of those.  I can imagine you probably have to make similar decisions in your own work when deciding where to allocate your own resources. How about I send you my kudos once you fix this bug?

not_technical,"Other linters will complain about comments at the end of a line of code.

not_technical,"You've been doing more than that.  You're free to follow your choice of religion/philosophy, and various people such as ChainReactive, myself, and others are free to follow our own choices of religion/philosophy.  It's unethical and inappropriate if you frequently try to push or manipulate forum participants into joining your religion/philosophy. If I followed your recommendation and adopted your religion/philosophy, then it would substantially damage the upbringing of my children.  That would be even worse than unethical -- it would be monstrous to harm my children in that way. Then don't.  Nothing about what i've said insists that you do this.  It merely offers you the choice of doing this.  It's not unethical to make ones time available to help people freely if they are interested.  I do this in many avenues in life.  I freely offer tutoring for many different subjects.  I freely offer assistance with learning different programming languages.  I freely offer time and information toward contributing to some FOSS projects. So you're saying *i'm* operating unethically for offering my time and knowledge to people who may want it because if *you* were to take me up on it it would hurt you?  Does that not strike you as ridiculous?  Should i also not offer free tutoring for interested students because if some were to take it they might be negatively impacted in other avenues of life? Does it not make more sense (and seem more ethical) to have this be available and to leave it entirely to you (and others) to decide if you want to take it or not?  I don't see how this is at all a religion, but i certainly can see how it's a philosophy.  And it's a philosophy that has worked well for dozens of people out there.  I think it's a good thing that I can help out, and I'll continue to do so and will continue to announce this possibility so that if there are people out there (even if its not you) will know and can take advantage of it if they wish."
not_technical,"Great, I think this solution will successfully prevent this issue being reported in future again as a bug.  To my surprise, it was even possible to satisfy all users automatically without the burden of creating yet another option in the Options window. This horribly annoying behavior in Visual Studio bothered me multiple times today.  It's so unbelievably annoying!  I'll upgrade to VS 2019 just for this improvement once it's available.  I'm anxiously awaiting."
not_technical,"as mentioned in this post here. In other words, if a community member wanted to contribute such a PR, roslyn would take it.  however, absent that, the advice would be to just put in a blank line in the code.

not_technical,"I wholeheartedly agree with that. mikedn has contributed greatly and we totally appreciate all the skills & expertise for that reason. But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior.  Purely practical reasons -- I was only made aware of this issue today and I believe what I said needed to be said.  Our goal is to create an inclusive and respectful community and that includes all of us: Microsoft employees, frequent contributors, and newcomers. But these are only hollow words unless we're willing to drive change where necessary. And that includes reminding people to be respectful if their actions aren't and removing people who refuse to do so. From looking at the OSS ecosystem and listening to other communities it's clear to me that ignoring toxic behavior in the spirit of taking the high road does nothing but normalizing said toxic behavior. That's why I said what I said.  I can very much relate to that. Thus, I'd ask you to consider that this applies to other people as well. As far as I know, the vast majority of folks working on .NET do that because they love working on this stuff.  But how much fun do you think it is to hear that someone you respect tells you that you don't know what you're are talking about?  Code reviews and PR discussions are often controversial *because* people care. We're all guilty of saying things that come across much harsher than we intended. Being respectful doesn't mean not making mistakes, it means unwillingness to learn from them and/or doubling down on them. And I for one am not willing to tell people to suck it up because that's just the culture we have. We generally don't have that culture internally or with our community. And the places where we do I consider it a defect that needs to be fixed. And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences.  There was no real controversy here. I asked a question and I was expecting a reasonable answer, especially considering that it wasn't me who started this. Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. So now you're trying to explain to me how persistent shoot from the hip style commenting is respectful or not? Frankly I'm not sure what exactly it is. Let's just say that it is distasteful.

not_technical,"I didn't read the comment (it's deleted). In general, for comments that are just a bit too harsh, we typically ""hide"" them instead of deleting them. It's a soft way of communicating that a comment included some text that could be offensive to someone, and then only people that are really curious see it, and everyone generally gets on with the topic. That's what we've done elsewhere and something to consider. Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because ""you have no clue what you're talking about"" is toxic behavior. OSS is also about building & nurturing a community and that also includes involving people who still learn and have passion for the subject. We're not just here to review, merge, and maintain *your* PRs and ideas.

KDE is one of the very biggest community in linux. Maui is part of KDE. So much for Microsoft  Linux."
not_technical,"so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. There isn't major support for MauiKit, the likelihood is that most people probably never heard of it before today, and there is no widespread adoption of it. Can you name 10 large companies that have adopted it? Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. Are you an  official  Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?."
not_technical,"Hi all, the official legal name is .NET Multi-platform App UI and MAUI is an acronym, code name. This has been through legal review.

Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I.

not_technical,"What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like ""you're all mad"" or ""it's the others' fault, they need to rename"" (aka ""we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply"" or, my favorite, ""same name is not a problem at all"", pretending that confusion was not an issue...  dansiegel great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! Really! Is that how Microsoft's unpaid marketers aka ""Microsoft MVP"" are chosen? How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old ""it's a big evil company"" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense...  Remember, Microsoft recently admitted they've been on the wrong side of history with regard to open source. You have *zero* reason to belittle this or  any  other open-source project. Especially since this one's also open-source. Imagine trying to put up a facade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao"

not_technical,"Maybe because ""Core"" is not a marketed Microsoft product name, but a component of a marketed product named "".NET""? There is Qt Core, and somehow Qt Core and .NET Core don't read as similar as ""MAUI"" and ""MAUI"" do. projects do have value based on the value that they provide. The most notable measure of that is the community around that project. You might not like hearing it but MauiKit doesn't seem to have a community. It looks like a side project. I asked before Can you name 10 large companies that have adopted it? and you didn't or couldn't.  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project.

What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called."
not_technical,Email me. Stealing is not ok and has not been intended. Happy to work through conflicts. projects do have value based on the value that they provide. The most notable measure of that is the community around that project. You might not like hearing it but MauiKit doesn't seem to have a community. It looks like a side project. I asked before Can you name 10 large companies that have adopted it? and you didn't or couldn't.  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. I do not see a community around that project at all. I do not see adoption within the enterprise. What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called.
not_technical,"Somehow all other cross-platform frameworks I can think of have managed to choose a name that would not conflict with other similar projects. I wonder what's so different here that would prevent Microsoft from finding a scope-unique name. so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. There isn't major support for MauiKit, the likelihood is that most people probably never heard of it before today, and there is no widespread adoption of it. Can you name 10 large companies that have adopted it? Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous."
not_technical,"That is great, but I did not ask that. If no representative wants to even  talk   about this, so be it.

not_technical,"I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui.

not_technical,"You can be mad all you want, but let's be realistic here... this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub."
not_technical,"Since the issue was opened a mere 60 minutes ago‚ There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository.

not_technical,"That's because it's a mirror. The actual project is developed in KDE gitlab instance. They even refer  themselves  to Hawaii. Check, its commit message says, ""Aloha fix"". I don't think they took into account either confusion with the ""Linux project"" *nor with the Hawaiian island*. (By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? Come on, get over this ""Linux vs. Windows"" mantra you still seem to follow.) Edit: yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which."

What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like ""you're all mad"" or ""it's the others' fault, they need to rename"" (aka ""we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply"" or, my favorite, ""same name is not a problem at all"", pretending that confusion was not an issue...  dansiegel great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! Really! Is that how Microsoft's unpaid marketers aka ""Microsoft MVP"" are chosen? How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old ""it's a big evil company"" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense...  Remember, Microsoft recently admitted they've been on the wrong side of history with regard to open source.

not_technical,WCF on .NET core will be critical for out migration and adoption of .NET core.  We're leveraging many of the capabilities of WCF and without a clear migration path core won't be as compelling. These are requirements.  1. Transactions 2. A transactional queuing programming model 3. Extensibility model Another vote for WC on .net core. I have an entire infrastructure that is being converted to netstandard and core however we are currently deliberating what to do about not having WCF available. WCF for us means that developers can easily consume a complex api with almost no knowledge of it. Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-(
not_technical,"What I mean by that is, I don't have to write a thousand page how to and hand it over for someone else to use the API. So, if I say to another dev hey the API you need for that is at this address I can basically end the conversation at that when using WCF.  Phillip, are you saying you don't like productivity? Do you not like the idea of inexperienced devs? Are you a ""I am the greatest dev alive"" guy? because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming.  I personally have taken on the task of creating a compatible library which handles the basic WCF functionality and written the service interfaces into a shared library. While not as flexible as WCF, it is in fact a lot faster than a full implementation. My internal time to return a call is now less than 1ms (net rx to tx of simple message), which WCF can't compete with. This is all nice and dandy, however I still yearn for WCF. Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF.  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again."
not_technical,"Let me also mention the value of WCF in .NET core.  WCF gives the best capabailities across all my services. (Perhaps we need a sexier name for it) but in general, I use and wish to continue to use: - **System.Transactions** - **Durable services** - **Named pipes** - **An extensibility model** - **Transactional Queuing** - **MEX framework (and MEX endpoint)**  And when we can run these services on Linux (and eventually IOS), it allows the most solid framework  Paul Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. At it's current state WCF is THE most universal and mature framework to communicate between devices, and within devices using Named Pipes. Over the wire, it adheres to common standards allowing other platforms to communicate as well. But with WCF running in .Net core, the choice will be easy to make."
not_technical," Hi,  I too appreciate WCF, and use it a lot. For me the most important features are: - Security - Extensibllity - Behaviors - Bindings (Especially TCP.Net) - Metadata Exchange - Instance Management - Reliability  I think this could really be a showstopper for .Net core, if it will not have WCF server side support."
not_technical,"OK we're done here, and that makes me sad.  People want WCF because they're connecting to systems outside of their control, or for back compat, or for the things REST simply doesn't do. Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful.  I will remind you that we have a code of conduct which includes prohibitions on  - Personal attacks - Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments  Please read it and understand why we have this in place. Hi,  I'd like to start a thread to have a dialog about server side WCF on .NET Core. For me the WCF stack is quite impressive, and support for server side WCF on .NET Core would be fantastic. Please feel free to add your opinions to the thread.  Here is a list of some of the WCF features (that comes to my mind): - Throttling - Reliability - Ordered Messages - Bindings - Instance Management - Behaviors - Transactions - Security - Discovery - Metadata Exchange - Extensibility  These features and more are for me very desirable, but some might be harder to support (e.g. WCF transactions relies on MS DTC (as fas as I know), but transactions enabled communication on a server side is a very important feature).  I hope you're as excited as I am about WCF, and even more so for a server side WCF on .NET Core."
not_technical,"I agree with websitewill as I am in that exact situation. I'd also like to point out that WCF in the full .NET Framework is done, finished, complete. If that spec were implemented to the letter in .NET Core I'd be very content and would be able to start transitioning projects.  Thanks, Kenny I have to throw my support for WCF in .NET Core as well.  My primary client is a fairly large, heterogeneous WAN with intermittent connectivity.  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows.  The thought of bringing all of WCF's many capabilities (as enumerated in this thread) to my client's entire infrastructure would literally be a dream come true. We can spend the vast efforts we've previously put toward plumbing into the services that can streamline everything we do, and take us to the next level.  Please, please make this happen.  -Thomas"
not_technical,"If the premise of .NET Core is to be everywhere, there ought to be a universal mechanism (WCF, or an improved successor to WCF) that connects everything together, don't you think? Why should it matter to your apps what platform your devices are running? Likewise, why should it matter how to get a message from point A to B reliably and securely, handling the serialization/deserialization, over a buffered/streamed/queued transport, supporting transactional rollback of a call chain, with fault exception propagation, etc? WCF came close to offering a universal connection mechanism with an extensible pipeline. Frameworks that do web services with REST over HTTP don't even come close.  The Windows specific part that comes to mind is distributed transaction support that relies on MSDTC. I'll leave it to the Microsofties to figure out how to NuGet and port that to non-Windows platforms. If you don't like it, don't use it!!! Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why?  I have been using WCF on some major back end infrastructure since 2013 and have never had a problem.  I am currently refactoring/rewriting a lot of WCF code to use on Linux which will use what I have dubbed UCF (Universal Communications Foundation). So far it is working great and while it is not full WCF it does use the same structuring and tags.  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... I will even take an article written by some random guy who knows nothing but javascript written on Wikipedia, just show me something.  Many companies, both large and small, use WCF! The ability to run .NET Core on Linux is huge and is being widely adopted. The idea of write once run anywhere that took off with Java is now moving to .NET. This is in part because of the language offerings of .NET (F#, C#, VB, C++...). Another big factor is the way Oracle treats the open source community (very poorly as of late) and the fact that Microsoft is doing the exact opposite by opening code not closing it off. C# is also a huge draw as it is very popular with both novice and expert programmers which allows many companies to hire lower level developers.  I personally and I am sure many others agree, that having higher developers create consumable nearly foolproof services and feeding lower level developers the basics of how it works is both a time and money saver. The only real reason I can see anyone truly hating WCF and want to see it gone is that the either, don't have much experience with it, they are a senior developer that feels like creating positions for lower levels may cause job insecurity.  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.**"
not_technical,"I really like youngsters telling about how fancy is using Web Api for their startups (I do too), however we also have here tons of enterprise grade software hosted on IIS and using WCF as an extremnely flexible communication stack abstracting transport layer from a developer, we do have tons of partner organization integrations using various versions of SOAP protocol. Are you telling me to code my own SOAP stack using web api or OWIN middleware? ,) I do not think so. Having no WCF Server Side support in Core makes it unusable and not even an option for consider thus effectively limiting its adoption, which I think is not MS wants. I would welcome WCF on OWIN more than warmly, then we would be having complete .NET Core offering when it comes to communicating. Interoperability should be implemented using open standards and lightweight technologies such as RESTfull web, micro services. XML is supported if you'd like.  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good."
not_technical,"This couldn't be any better of a reason to NOT support WCF. It's possible you misunderstood the comment.  I believe the reason that Allen made that comment (and I'd love to hear his actual reason) is that using WCF gives you two specific things in terms of an API.  First, it's gives the true separation of dependencies and implementation (ala - the actor model and service orientation).  Second, it supports an interface based programming model. By only having access to the proxy, those using the API only need to know the proxy to use it.  [Granted, that can still require a great deal of knowledge, but not of the implementation.]"
not_technical,"You do know it's the first week of 2018, right? OK we're done here, and that makes me sad.

not_technical,"Having WCF supported in .NET Core is a great idea and my list of key features are:  Security Behaviors Bindings Instance Management Throttling Metadata Exchange. Our team used WCF to build an entire SOA platform. Each service is hosted in it's own app domain that provides complete isolation for every service. This allowed us to monitor resources, per service, and unload a service and swap it out with the app hot. I know app domains are gone, but what could possibly replace wcf?  Service Bus + Net Messaging Binding Net Pipe binding strongly typed headers and contexts Behaviors and interception MEX  you have a super reliable, and extendable set of tools. wcf provides the best tools for building enterprise applications. Without it, you simply end up rebuilding it.  Bringing the power of wcf to other platforms would be huge.  Linux + sql + wcf + service bus + .net core looks good to me."
not_technical,"WCF applications on Core would be a huge boon.  The only thing I would explicitly like to add to the OP's features are all of the behavior types (not just the ones available in Service Fabric) - Operation Behaviors - Service Behaviors - Contract Behaviors - Endpoint Behaviors  I distributed transactions are a prohibitive factor, they can be thrown out the window though. Service Bus binding of WCF is absolutely amazing for building push based reactive applications"
not_technical,"Thanks for input. The implementation of back-end systems needs a mature communication stack, such as WCF. As you pointed out in the thread, a .NET Core positioned on the client side is in my mind taking away the potential of what .NET Core can be.  I'm sure we all can wire basic communication (TCP, HTTP, ...) and then get bogged down into details about message parsing, to get some implementation of back-end on .NET Core. I'll stick my neck out and  claim that WCF takes a lot of plumbing away from development (reduces waste and error prone code), letting us focus on business value. That is the reason why I enjoy WCF so much, and really would love to see support for server side WCF in .NET Core, rather sooner than later. Thanks for all the feedback on WCF Server top features! Keep it coming!  Providing WCF Server support for .NET Core is on the radar.  As you know, our current POR is to provide the WCF client-side libraries in .NET Core to enable UWP/ ASP.NET Core/.NET Core applications to call .NET Framework based WCF Services.  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. Is this blocking your adoption .NET Core? Do you have active projects on .NET Core for WCF Server scenarios? (We would like to partner closely with you) Would you plan to port over your existing services or is this for needed new development?"
not_technical,"I do consider a full WCF implementation to be a prerequisite for moving to .NET core. Without it, it will remain a variation of the .NET Framework that cannot be utilized behind the firewall of major enterprise applications that employ Service Orientation. The major features I rely on that haven't been mentioned are: - Net.TCP Binding - Net.Pipe Binding - Interception-based Pipeline - Context - Headers - Contract-based Coding Model  The two bindings are required to enable the efficiency of communication that Service Oriented systems require behind the firewall.  The interception is critical to allow architects to provide the necessary aspects of the system in a way that does not require the developers to do anything except code as they normally would.  Contexts and Headers are required to propagate information that is ubiquitous through the application's stack from the client layer all the way down to the data layer and back up again without affecting the call contracts. Here, I'm thinking about identity information as a universal example.  The contract-based coding model is really necessary to avoid going back to the string-parsing voodoo that had us living in a type-uncertain, data-validity-in-question wild-west back when Microsoft thought passing hash tables to and from SOAP web services was a good idea.

not_technical,"I didn't try the ninja build. Essentially I got this one working flawlessly by putting symlinks to gcc, g++ & cc in a local directory that is in front of PATH.  I would personally say the build feels to be going quite well so far and I think I'm not that far away from having a working runtime. Though the porting effort is paused until the next weekend. any update on your effort? I would really love to see DartVM on the BSD's (FreeBSD in particular) ... and I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills."
not_technical,"We are looking at how to integrate a non-supported and non-tested platform into the bleeding-edge tree without adding an undue burden on the mainline development. The current plan is that only officially supported platforms are going to be maintained by the Dart team in general. This means that for example any of the BSD ports can and will likely break often as we rely on new OS features or make changes to the OS dependent APIs.  To reduce the maintenance effort for the supported platforms, we will likely need that all of the BSD variants (Open, Free, Net) coexist in a single set of xyz bsd.cc and h files. As you may have noticed the OP is about supporting the Dart VM on FreeBSD, but the current code review is for OpenBSD. So we know that we have interest in at least two of the variants.  Thank you for your continued patience. As someone who has worked in the open source ecosystem for the better part of 15 years, I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. As you have chosen to open up your project for collaboration, you need to provide a street that goes both directions. As people contribute to you, they are establishing themselves as your user base. Whether or not you set out to support a certain platform or not, as your project grows that idea of ""support"" may have to change. Looking at how you advertise dart, I do not see a way you can accomplish your goals without supporting the BSD projects. While they may not carry the same numbers as linux, it is rather self deprecating to reject work that someone has done for you on the claim that it creates more work for you. Frankly, it is confusing and frustrating that some projects at google choose to embrace the open source ecosystem in its entirety, (golang comes to mind, supporting quite a few hardware archs on several of the BSD's), while dart seems to want to limit itself. You have drawn your obvious line in the sand, and I wish you the complete return on your decision."
not_technical,"I have some suggestions on maintaining clear separation between the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically and ones that are supported by the community:  - Add the separation via the build system so that the build step that you use to build the install ready binaries does not by default build binaries for non-supported hosts. - Keep the files ending with  openbsd.cc and  openbsd.h in the source directory (if you don't want to see the OpenBSD files in the bin/runtime directory for whatever reason, consider moving the host specific files into a single separate directory for host-specific code or to multiple separate directories based on what is being specialized for each host). - Add disclaimers on each of the files that are specific to non-supported hosts explaining that these hosts are not being supported directly by Google and that the Dart SDK is only available on these hosts because of generous contributions from people from the community who spent their limited time porting the Dart SDK to a new host so that they could enable the usage of the Dart SDK on that host for the benevolence of the Dart community.  I also think it's unreasonable ask mulander to add support for all of the BSD operating systems in one set of files ending in  bsd.cc and bsd.hh as mulander would have to then add support for at least two different operating systems which is quite extreme (show some empathy and think about the human cost (in terms of time and effort) that would be required to learn about all the different BSD operating systems and then validating and testing the code on a few of the major BSD operating systems just to get the work that was already done for OpenBSD merged upstream). I started the FreeBSD port 1 year ago ... and was able (like I commented here above) to build and pass most of the tests. I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep."

We talked about this and came up with a proposal that might help us get support for OpenBSD landed while addressing some of the raised concerns.  I'm happy that you talked. It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. I am trying to move this issue forward and get a resolution. It is possible that moving the files to third party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen.  I understand the comment earlier from iposva-google about the possibility of refactoring the OS specific files to share code but as indicated in that comment we request that you start with a bsd version and look at refactoring later."
not_technical,"any update on your effort? I would really love to see DartVM on the BSD's (FreeBSD in particular) ... and I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. I was able to last work on this port on September 19th. Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. I did not abandon the porting effort - it's just on hold for now. Initial porting effort. Normal branch to work on upstreaming proper support. he started a similar effort to port Dart to NetBSD based on my current status, his repository is here: (also on hold from what I know).  though it should be noted I am porting this for OpenBSD not FreeBSD though as you might be aware the work should be really similar (same with NetBSD as we found out). You can start by forking the dart repository and adding * freebsd.cc/h files based on the ones I added in my repository. That should get you pretty far building the code on FreeBSD. It just needs time. I'm also not the best person to do this but look at the age of this ticket. If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. I will gladly help you get to the same spot on FreeBSD that I am with OpenBSD. Feel free to ask me question or just grab query with me on IRC on freenode."
not_technical,"Any chance of a FreeBSD port? I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on.  As such, I've moved my focus to other platforms that *do* have support for \*BSD. I understand that the team may have different priorities, and I also understand that the majority of their customer base likely wouldn't benefit directly from \*BSD support.  This may have changed in the past, but getting set up to even work on this was a daunting task since it was (again, not sure if this has changed) part of the monolithic Chromium source tree. As such, I put *some* effort into porting (about a day of work), but it was such a huge barrier to entry that I lost interest and moved on to other projects."
not_technical,"Hi! A quick status update! I was able to build the runtime on FreeBSD by patching 25 files (using linux plataform as base with some files from macos), including several gyp files. I will now try to build all the sdk and then make a proper Platform for FreeBSD and will try to coordinate my effort with mulander so we can have FreeBSD and OpenBSD (NetBSD will be also easy). Currently I have 10/3785 failed tests: I don't know if the tests are failing because of the port ... or because of the PRE-1.14 status of the rep. Running the tests with this, I get 8 tests failed - 2 could not be categorized or are in multiple categories  So ... I'm confused .....  Can someone give me some guidance on what to look for (thread implementation, etc..) if any of the failed tests are unexpected failures?  I forgot to mention ...

not_technical,"I did so.  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*.  The data (user with IP X has opened Atom at time Y) is transmitted to third parties regardless of whether or not Microsoft is collecting or using this information as telemetry.  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from ""the telemetry package"" or not.  It's still useful as telemetry, and is sent without consent.

It must be treated as such, regardless of intent, because that is the *effect*.   I'm not sure how it would A/B test, but my guess is that having auto-updates default to off would result in a lot less automatically updated Atom clients.  Is this a worse thing than every single Atom user reporting to their ISP and national governments and Microsoft for permanent logging exactly when and where they open their text editor every single time? Atom is designed to run in an internet connected environment   Is this documented somewhere? And why is this a design constraint? Speaking generally, I would propose the opposite, that a text editor be designed to be fully capable in all respects when offline.  It's an expected scenario to check for updates, it's not a  constraint  though. As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). You can even turn off checking for updates in the settings if you want, although that wouldn't prevent the first run connection this issue is about."

not_technical,"It's an expected scenario to check for updates, it's not a constraint though.  **It is not an expected scenario from the user's perspective.** With great respect, you're just wildly mistaken. Consider the following flow: User looks at your privacy policy. User reads the first sentence and thinks that consent will be requested for outbound connections. User obtains an installer. User launches app and app immediately phones home without consent.  I think we all understand that there are strong Business Intelligence incentives to want to collect  installation data. Those incentives only get answered by pushback, in micro-processes like this thread. Would it persuade the BI audience if they sat back and contemplated a legal review of this under the CCPA? Just a reminder that enforcement starts July 1, 2020.   You can even turn off checking for updates in the settings if you want, although that wouldn't prevent the first run connection this issue is about.  You've simply restated the problem. I don't disagree with you, just trying to play devil's advocate a bit. There's clearly a reason Atom's team believes auto-updates on by default is of high importance. Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. Nor is telling users to fork your app if they don't like it.  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, neilpanchal's comment is worth discussing more."

This isn't something the Atom team is currently interested in changing though. I've already done so, naturally.  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes?

If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc ""user has launched the app"" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?  It would still work just fine, and wouldn't be transmitting user activity on every launch."
not_technical,"Atom is designed to run in an internet connected environment, doing things such as checking for updates (your first dialog) without prompting the user. The second dialog you show is from the telemetry package which clearly states that if you opt out it will send an anonymous report of an opt out and then ignore future data. You are certainly free to block the network access and Atom will work in an offline mode if that is your preference, if that is not what you desire though there are plenty of other editors out there that may fit your needs better. Atom is fully open source so you are welcome to build your own version that fits your requirements, note that the  branding  is copyrighted so if you do that and decide to publish it you can't call it Atom.  Thanks for reaching out!  We have passed along the information to the maintainers team. Because we treat our issues list as the Atom team's backlog, we close feedback issues after passing along the information to the maintainers to keep our backlog clean and focused. In the future, if you want to send feedback to the maintainers you can do so more directly by sending email to atomgithub.com. Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network.  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**.  That's *why the consent dialog exists*.  Very obviously this is a bug: the auto-update mechanism, which is itself a form of telemetry so long as it uses the network (transmitting to the manufacturer that the user has installed Atom), must be serialized to occur *only after* their consent (or lack thereof) to telemetry is indicated.  Doing it beforehand renders the telemetry opt-out entirely ineffective, as you *still end up sending telemetry* to the ""what version is current"" service, even when the user doesn't want it sent.  That seems to be a recurring issue, as well: #20185 elaborates on that."

Can we change the hashtag on the main page to #WhiteJesusIsHoldingYouBack ?

Yes, black lives matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Latino lives matter, gay lives matter, lesbian lives matter, vegan lives matter, stutterer lives matter, little people lives matter, disabled lives matter, left-handed people lives matter, colorblind lives matter.

Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct.  Precisely this. Angular/Google are just using the platform to promote their local political views on the matter. It reminds me of the day when gay marriage was legalized in the US and Stack Overflow celebrated it with a rainbow logo.  This answer explained it nicely. The owners and operators of Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow have made it amply clear that while we as users and contributors are not permitted to use the site and our audience here to promote our political and social beliefs, they, as the owners may.  With an unfortunate conclusion: Indeed, there's not much you can do about it. People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away ""cause y'all can't behave"" and ""the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"". From the top of my head, previously it's been determined that blacklist and whitelist is racist. Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about the master branch and that is actually non-ironically happening now, because apparently there exist people who hear ""master"" and immediately think about slavery. I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. Also a man being smart is sexist towards women because why not.

On another note: For me, it was totally not clear that this ad was for a company that donates to standard. So it took me a while to figure out where this ad came from. So I'm not sure what the ad should convey, but I don't think it is the feeling ""what is this and how do I get rid of it?"". First off, I love standard and use it in all my JS projects. Thank you so much for your hard work in making a fantastic, easy-to-use, and solid linter.  I was really taken off guard seeing this in my terminal today. It's the last place I expect to see an ad, and really the last place I want to. While I get the idea behind it, and I agree that we must think of innovative ways to support open-source, relying on displaying an ad in a place that typically doesn't have them opens up the doors to new behavior of ad spamming when I simply want to install a dependency.  I'm not saying this is the case here, but let's say that this really frustrates a percentage of developers and they decide to no longer use the project/tool/library, but the project does see an uptick in sponsorship. More than likely they'd see that as a win, and this could slowly shift the focus from a community-driven project to a sponsorship-driven project (and not as in individual sponsors, but company sponsorship). Again, I'm not saying this is the case here, but you can sort of see how that could happen if this becomes a normal practice in how we try to support open-source projects.  I'd much rather see an innovative solution that tries to encourage individual community members to give more to projects they want to support rather than relying on sponsorship ads.  Finally, I also agree with mhogerheijde, when I first saw this I was confused, and my initial thought was to immediately find the package and to remove it since it wasn't clear at all where this was coming from or why an ad was in my terminal.

But I will say that it pollutes install logs and I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the tragedy of the commons."

not_technical,"Since funding is one of the dependencies, it's in the list. Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed."
not_technical,"I just recieved this response.  Hello, We definitely understand your objection to an advertisement of this nature. This ad was not paid for or solicited by Linode. There is an open issue/thread regarding this advertisement on the package's Github repository.  We appreciate you voicing your concerns about this ad, and I've passed along your feedback to our team who will be investigating this matter. If you have any other questions or concerns please let us know.  I expect this was merely a misunderstanding on the part of this support agent. He probably wasn't aware of the facts.  They have public tweets where they say they've ""reconsidered"": Linode has been very supportive at exploring new ways to support open source. It's a bummer that this didn't work out, but I understand and don't hold it against them. Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed."
not_technical,"I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. Some JS packages have dozens, hundreds, or even more dependencies- can you imagine what it would look like if every package did this? Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way.  We humans are opportunists.  Any time a cost to us is >0 we will not like that cost and we'll complain about it.  In discussing a problem whose solution is necessarily going to impart a cost it doesn't need to be stated that those who need to shoulder said cost are going to find it less preferable than having it at no cost.  This inner alt-right perspective is expected.   Anyway, the solution to monetizing an artist's reproducible work has already been solved.  It's called copyright.  We the People have expressly removed our liberty to freely copy an artist's work and granted that right solely to the creator in order to give the artist the ability to financially support his artistic output.   To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint."
not_technical,"All the rationalizations aside, let's be honest and call this what it is: an attempt to redefine terms.  Writing software for no compensation is what you signed up for when you put OSS out there.  And now you realize you don't like that.  You made a mistake, own up to it. The short answer is that WinUI relies on the underlying OS, even in it's decoupled state.  WinUI is the UI framework, and can be updated faster than the OS.  As for your views about Windows 10, you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from.  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous, but I hope I have provided an accurate answer to your query."
not_technical,"I read through the thread again, and it seems like the OP was trying it out by installing it --save-dev, but the funding package's behavior should be the same regardless of how it's installed. What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. I wonder how many poor newbs have thought this is official."
not_technical,"People disagreeing with you aren't a mob, they're real people that just so happen to have a different opinion than you on the matter. There may be one or two people acting inappropriately, as I have seen myself on both sides, but for the majority people are just sharing their views.  I don't think anyone, either for or against this experiment, should not have their opinion heard. That very much too goes for people who support the proposal and I hope everyone can share their feedback. You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a ""standard"" and monetize it. This is not a ""FOSS project"", it's a publicity/advertisment stunt. How do you reconcile your views with the fact that this guy plans to get paid pretty much for someone else's work (ESLint)?"
not_technical,"I took the time to compile a bug report, only to be closed instantly as a duplicate when nothing in ""duplicate"" is same as in my bug report? At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. You see symptoms, we see the underlying cause for them, and we tell you that these are both symptoms of the exact same bug. A duplicate bug report is not a bad thing, it just confirms the bug with possibly slightly different steps to reproduce. It's pointless to keep two or 50 issues open about the same bug, so we close duplicates, usually keeping the oldest one open."
not_technical,"It does not work, read the code. If it worked the material would be plain white. I mean it compiles and runs, at least that what title suggests: ""Strange syntax is **allowed** to pass global parameters to the shader function"". It ""works"" as in the functions gets TIME from context of a fragment (not passed argument in call) which doesn't happen in my case - it crashes during compilation because probably renaming fails. Here, renamed, be happy."
not_technical,"Maybe same reason, but the result is different and expected behaviour as well. Not true (if I understand you correctly), g function clearly demonstrates the TEXTURE does not exist. And f is fed a valid variable from fragment function (unlike the ""duplicate"" issue), yet the shader **fails** to compile (also unlike the ""duplicate"" issue).  Kinda glad I will be leaving Godot, this ""duplicate"" labeling feels as lazy as on stackoverflow... You could add these descriptions to the original ""duplicate"" issue and this is fine. I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot."

I've tested my changes in hundreds of matches with great feedback. The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game.  So, first up, ARTILLERY.  These values allow the artillery to remain effective, but not overpowered. Instead of 3 arty destroying a huge infantry blob, you'll 4-6 of them. Damage vs vehicles has been buffed slightly to compensate for lack of infantry killing. A direct hit will kill the infantry, but if it lands off to the side, it can take anywhere from 1-4 shots. With a small group of artillery firing, the aoe will make it a lot more effective.  Cost also went up, and it's speed has been slowed down. I think I buffed it vs buildings too, maybe not.  Now, the artillery infantry tradeoff is fair, and for what it lacks in anti infantry, it makes up for by doing roughly 10-20% more dmg to everything else."
not_technical,"You can tell npm what folders/files to put inside a package via the files param. I never tried it for sub-directories, but if I got what you are aiming at this could be enough to solve the mentioned problem right? Based on what you can say that? So, based on what you can assume that you are right saying that the package is too big? What will be your argument that I have to pay attention to re-exporting on the main file? Well, I wouldn't re-export anything if that is your case, the whole point of having files that behave as a module scope in NodeJS. Could you show me how to resolve this issue please?

Not because my clients are Microsoft et al but because they have contractually approved lists of licenses that we can use and this license will not qualify.  The intent is pretty clear, but the unfortunate side effect is that it also screws with many developers who use this tool. I know this wasn't your intention but it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll  maybe  release this as a patch."

not_technical,"I disagree with this feature request. Firstly, I tilted my head in confusion when I read ""ugly racial slur"", because none came to mind. Took me a couple of seconds of staring at ng-repeat to understand what you mean. I think that the girl was in a vast minority of people who would interpret ng-repeat as the word I assume you're referring to. In fact, I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. Did the girl really not notice the pattern of ng-app-ng-init-ng-model-ng-if leading to ng-repeat? Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing  any  of the directives as ""en-gee"" during the whole workshop.  Furthermore, a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the ng- prefix is by no means ""evidence that it is a confusing name"". Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. Replacing the directive would not make the project more ""inclusive"". There are several definitions for this word, but I will assume that you meant this one: ""not excluding any section of society or any party involved in something"" (please correct me if my assumption was incorrect). The project is already as inclusive as it gets:  everyone  is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing ng- to ang- would not affect this fact, positively or negatively.  Also, it would certainly not be ""easier to remember"" because that would mean changing every existing material online. It would be a huge breaking change and I'm sure that a huge portion of developers would be outraged. Angular already had one issue with renaming few years ago, which brings me to the following point: ng-repeat is not an Angular directive. It comes from a different framework called AngularJS, so this issue is opened in a wrong place. Angular uses ngFor. By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task."

Given our past experience with these kinds of issue discussions getting out of hand due to comments from people outside of our team, I'm going to lock this thread until we have a chance to respond. Thanks for understanding. We've discussed this issue quite a bit. We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. It was never our intention. ""ng"" simply stands for a*NG*ular - the two characters in the middle of the name. And the name Angular has its roots in angle brackets that are the key part of HTML syntax that Angular uses. After reviewing the current names of APIs that are prefixed with ng we concluded that ng-repeat was the only one that stood out as potentially problematic. Fortunately, the latest versions of Angular use ngFor instead of  ng-repeat. ng-repeat is no longer used by Angular and was deprecated along with AngularJS a few years ago, so this api is no longer used in new development. For these reasons, we will not make any changes in our current APIs, but we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs. Thank you for bringing it to our attention."

FWIW, the relevant design is as follows:  Any time a ##vso command appears in stdout it is processed - regardless of where it appears in the output. If you set a variable twice, the second time you set it wins out. ##vso commands are wiped from the output (though you can see that they were successfully processed in diagnostic mode).

not_technical,"Atom is using an electron API to move items to the trash, this API used to default to gvfs-trash but this got changed in electron v3 to default to gio.

I am unable to delete file (or directory). When trying, the following message appears: Is gvfs-trash installed?  ### Steps to Reproduce  1. Try to delete any file or directory 2. ??? 3. Profit  **Expected behavior:** Deleting file should delete file  **Actual behavior:** The file is not deleted  **Reproduces how often:** Every time  ### Versions ### Additional Information   gvfs-trash This tool has been deprecated, use 'gio trash' instead. See 'gio help trash' for more info.  The gio trash is supposedly implemented since electron 1.7.2 and for some folks out there this problem was fixed with Atom 1.25 (which included upgrade to Electron 1.7.11) but apparently I am on even newer Atom version, with even newer Electron and it still happens.  ### EDIT1 #### More insight on the problem provided by cutephoton: This is a legit bug. The  tldr answer  is that  g file trash may not be supported. In order for  g file trash to succeed, the following conditions must be met:   * The file being moved to trash is on the same partition as your home folder    **OR**  * A trash folder already exists or can be created at the mount point and,  * The trash folder is considered 'safe/secure' by verifying UID and restrictive permissions   **How this should probably be fixed...**   Atom does not have a fallback mechanism like offering the ability to permanently remove a file instead. This would address bring atom in line with gnome's graceful behaviour. The attached image show how Gnome Files (aka Nautilus) prompt the user to permanently delete the file (when trash not supported)  **Impact: Users with multiple disks and partitions**   Fedora/Redhat/etc:  Impacted  due to default partition scheme that separates / and /home in to partitions. Files outside of the /home partition cannot be moved to trash.   Ubuntu: Less likely due to partition layout (/home is part of the / partition)   Conditions where users will be impacted:   * File systems with unix permissions:     *  Impacted with workaround  due to typical restrictive top-level directory permissions (root)  * FAT/non-unix file systems:     * User Session Mount:  No Impact     * Fstab:  Impacted  even with permissive umask. The default uid/gid is root. It will be unable to satisfy the requirements of a trash folder without additional options (uid/gid/umask).  * Network shared folders:  Unknown/Did not test.    **Notes/Testing the Root Cause**   Note: Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me.   Initially I encountered this issue when I put files in a certain location like the reporter above. I created a delete-me file test as suggested above in the relevant directory, /opt/cupenv. I ran the command strace gio trash delete-me.txt. A abridged version of the output is here  That's unexpected. The API documentation for g file trash lacks some level of specificity.  Sends file to the ""Trashcan"", if possible. This is similar to deleting it, but the user can recover it before emptying the trashcan. Not all file systems support trashing, so this call can return the G IO ERROR NOT SUPPORTED error.   One might assume (as I did): Given a path, if the user has permission to modify/delete the file, then GIO's g file trash API should succeed at removing the file in some manner. Perhaps, if trash functionality is not available, then there might be a fallback mechanism. In the case of gio trash I expected there to be a -f force option that would prioritize trash over permanently deleting the file. (gio trash -f only ignores files that don't exist)   Glib appears to implement GIO local file access using glocalfile.c. The trash algorithm looks like this:   * Is the path on the same partition as the user's home directory? If so, move the file to the home trash folder if possible and exit.  * Given the path, locate the mount point top level directory (denoted as topdir in source)     * In my case, the primary partition    * A more typical case  * If topdir is found, pick one of topdir/.Trash/UID or topdir/.Trash-UID folder.     * If topdir/.Trash-UID and topdir/.Trash/UID exists: Validate proper UID and file permission (or fail)    * Try to create folder topdir/.Trash-UID. Validate proper UID and file permission (or fail)   At the end of the function we find G IO ERROR NOT SUPPORTED is returned when such a folder is not found and cannot be created.  Files located on the same partition as your home directory can always be moved to your user trash folder. On my operating system, the paths / and /home are separate partitions. I created a file /home/tmp/x where tmp and x are owned by my user. In this case, the files get moved to your HOME/.local/share/Trash folder.    But when mounting disks (external or internal) using fstab or mount commands (as opposed to session-based mounting) issues can arise. I tested a FAT file system with umask=0000 and uid/gid set to root.    You can see gio trash going through the motions. The operations succeeds but the command still reports an error.  GLib/Gio will not write to a trash directory with incorrect permissions/ownership. (Security?) Without unix permissions, trash will always fail on these mount points. Modifying fstab to appear similar to options used during session mounts (UID/GID set to user vs root, umask is set appropriately). Conveniently the source code has a comment that seems to strongly imply this is a known/expected.    Most of this was unnecessary, but I figured I'd show my work.  ### EDIT2 #### More insight, to not get confused as of the nature of the bug, and how to reproduce it (by cutephoton as well):  Yes, as reported, the ELECTRON TRASH environment variable is needed. This is the issue referenced #15949 bug. The issue reported here is not related to #15949. The error message related to gvfs-trash is a blunt tool (even access denied errors produce the same error message) so I understand why people are responding here.   The reporter clarifies one of the key symptoms here  And that led to my deep dive. My deep dive details the specific cases where trash becomes unavailable (i.e. when a trash folder cannot be safely created).  **I just revalidated my findings and unsurprisingly gio trash still fails.**   Anyhow, I wanted to clarify this so it doesn't get lost when/if atom devs look in to this issue."
not_technical,"It worked for me too, on Fedora 29, but not undefinitely: after a moment, Atom could not delete files anymore, just like the variable was no more defined.

I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens.  I would like to keep it simple and avoid ""cheat"" Atom that is using the ""real"" gvfs-trash.

not_technical,"nezoat please try my repo here which contains the flutter engine compiled with metal disabled so you can use SkSL warmup to reduce the jank. It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. I did some more investigation and it looks like there is just a bug in Skia working on Metal.  Why I think there is Skia bug: 1. Jank is not depend on device performance, in my case it is clearly visible on one specific **1 second long** animation  - on Metal on ALL devices I tested, there is only 2 frames displayed on first run, first frame and last. In case of OpenGL number of frames depend on how powerful device is. 2. For the same animation I took slowest possible Android device I could find, and it showed 4 frames. :) How is that possible that 5 years old low level Android device works faster than iPhone11, both running Flutter?Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! IMHO there is no need to postpone resolution until SkSL warmup for Metal is ready. Even more - SkSL warmup for Metal wont fix this issue, just hide it for some use cases. Reason to get 1* still will be present."
not_technical,"We're actively working on ""Test-based shader warmup #53609"" to solve this, but that may take some time. Before that, you can follow to compile a custom Flutter engine that turns off Metal and uses OpenGL so the SkSL warm-up would solve this issue. Flutter still used OpenGL on all iOS devices a few months ago so its performance would not be too far behind. Depending on the workload, your app may prefer trading Metal's other improvements for OpenGL's vastly faster shader warm-up performance. Admittedly, compiling the Flutter engine takes much more time than just clicking a button, turn on a flag, or running a single command. We could have made it much easier by providing an opt-out-Metal option. However, we don't know if that will bring more harm than good. That's why your feedback is valuable to us, and we'd love to hear feedback from as many app developers as possible. Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :("
not_technical,"Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. I asked around on several modding discords, looked at the source of several mods which implement such thing that I'm trying to and came to the conclusion that ASM is the only good way. I'm not threatening to coremod anything. The solutions I found were to coremod and I wanted to avoid that. **Which is why I made this PR.** Documentation on everything is always a issue, this will never go away. However its a simple concept, you're trying to add one quad to your item when rendered in the inventory. We have MANY things related to extending the item model, So I would tell you to start looking at the IModel interface, as well as the renderItemAndEffectIntoGUI/renderItemOverlayIntoGUI which gathers the model and passes through a hadleState function which you can easily build the extra bar onto. We also expose a model based font renderer so there's help with that. Combined with the MANY MANY posts and arguments that we've had on this issue tracker and the forums about the point of the model system is to REMOVE direct GL access from the mods/items. Your solution is to add a new hook that encourages modders to break GL. All you wont is your model to have one extra textured quad. Why does this need to be/encourage direct GL access? I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. And im getting tired of people posting under the same veiled threats every damn time. ""Do this now or i'll hack it with a coremod!"" You may not intend for your post to come across that way but it does. So some takeaways: Don't open your Prs with 'Im gunna ASM this if you dont add it' Which is what your post comes under. Don't go against the entire point of moving to a model system buy adding YetAnother place of calling direct GL code. If you find something that you THINK you can't do in Forge open a issue, or use the forums. Explore your options. State what options you have explored. And again DO NOT open your argument with do this or i'll asm it!"
not_technical,"It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. I have searched the issues of this repository without finding anything. There is literally no reason to assume or accuse that people haven't looked for something just because they didn't find the solution. It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. I asked around on several modding discords, looked at the source of several mods which implement such thing that I'm trying to and came to the conclusion that ASM is the only good way. I'm not threatening to coremod anything. The solutions I found were to coremod and I wanted to avoid that. **Which is why I made this PR.**"
not_technical,"[Edited to remove being a dick]  Lex, you solution has 2 major drawbacks:  1. It requires a a code-based model. The step from putting a png and a 3-line json model into the resources folder to coding a custom IModel is huge. 2. The quads you add with your model are in model space. They will then be transformed using the Matrix4f derived from the json model. To add a quad that aligns to screen pixels, you need to apply those transforms in reverse and also know what the target coordinates (y!) are.  Both of these tasks are not trivial. Using the BufferBuilder to throw a single colored quad onto the screen *is* trivial, especially as anyone who has ever made a GUI for any block knows how to do it. (and if they don't, the code in renderItemOverlayIntoGUI already does exactly that and can be copied very easily.)  Now, is direct GL access the only way to do that? No, it isn't. I can think of dozens of ways to supply overlays that don't need GL calls but still are much simpler to use than baking models on-the-fly. Even a callback that asks for a texture path + u/v/w/h to overpaint over the item would fulfill 95% of all usescases. But the number 1 solution people will propose when they run into this problem is ""do it like vanilla"". And killing any discussion at that point will ensure that the same will happen again and again. If you would like to readdress this as a series of prebuilt utilities to render extra bars or numbers over items in the inventory. Then we can readdress it as that. But moving things back 5 years by encouraging people to do even more direct GL access is not going to fly. Feel free to create a new issue or PR to discuss that avenue of things.  As for the whole topic of ASM. Let me state this directly and for the record. It is, by definition, possible to do ANYTHING in a coremod. Stating that you can/are using a coremod in a PR serves literally NO purpose. It is NOTHING but a threat that gets tranted to ""Do this or i'll hack shit with a coremod"" I do not bed to threats.  So, new guideline (I've instructed Mezz to make it official). Any mention of ASM or hints at using a coremod to do shit in your issue will result in the thread being locked, and potentially you being banned from the Forge repo. End of story, i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods."

not_technical,Thank you! Dont work with fb abd google
not_technical,"Thank you! Dude, you get a compliment from jstansbe which conveys a lot more information than a thumb up and you thumb down on the compliment?  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all.  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive.  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. So instead of doubling down just own it and I'll explain it in more detail. For example JSX & DSX only does the following 2 transforms (mentioned several times before):  Everything else is handled by the host language, so for example: how does it handle import of components named the same, answer: host language. I am not being dismissive, it is the way it is designed and the source of it's strength. You see if you separate markup and programming into separate files, you start to duplicate the programming inside the markup with simple constructs for 'if', etc. You end up building a declarative programming language inside the markup that can never be as powerful as the main programming language. So by bringing the markup into the programming language you have the best of both worlds and that's the power of JSX/DSX.  Notice above on (2) that the transform hardcoded <Widget and that's not always the case, so now you can specify that if needed as discussed before. Look at the transforms and now all symbols come from source or can be specified so there won't be some major magic gotchas in the future.  That's not true, you can have contrary opinion but you can't claim something true when I can proof otherwise. But that's the thing, I wanted the Flutter team to implement DSX but then I did it so what they need to implement is generic stuff that doesn't depend on DSX and DSX is not the only beneficiary. The browser js engine supports source maps which enabled an ecosystem of new languages in the browser that transpiled to js, it enabled the creation of Dart !!! and several others (Coffeescript, Typescript, Reason, etc). Dart could do the same now and benefit from the ecosystem that it helps bring up, all boats rise. I've already done it many times and the conclusion is that Plain Dart or DSX comes down to user preference, and the important thing is to provide option instead of forcing people one way.  I would use DSX because I prefer it, like spaces or tabs, type definition before or after the variable name. There is no point fighting for it, just accept that people have different preferences, there is more than 1 programming editor out there right?  Just your opinion, why do we use ""if"" statements in almost every language, 'for' statement, 'class', and now 'asyn/await'. Very good, now you gained my respect.  Thing is even if it gets closed again it won't stop people from asking for JSX-like capabilities. I have no ego but I do have short temper so there is no mistaking when someone pisses me off (it comes out right away). Not to offend you but your questions were not important. You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to."
not_technical,"When sorted by 'upvote', this feature request is listed 7th on the list of 3131 opened tickets though. I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like ""if you don't do x then horribly y will happen"" are just ridiculous."
not_technical,"If Devs are complaining about the difficulty of laying out the pages visually - an idea would be to create a layout designer which lets you set your themes and design pages visually by drag-and-drop. Then it would generate Flutter code which is not intended to ever be editted - but rather creates classes which can be used to compose your app.  It wouldnt need to be 2-way editing (XML/layout) like Android XML, but you just save your layout for later. If you need to change it you can regenerate the code and (hopefully) just change some arguments. I know this conversation is old and yes it was getting quite hot, But i will like to drop a few lines to what i consider is happening here.  Flutter is NEW. Its a completely NEW way to do things. Yes, it did borrow from the react paradigm. But doesn't mean it needs to follow its same steps. I don't think its the flutter's team objective to attract developers from react native to come to flutter, its only to build something new that developers might find interest in. Google uses it internally before sharing it with the world and they have been productive with it. I share the comments with Hixie that its not any different from JSX to build the UI. Yes its a little more verbose to right pure dart. But it actually makes debugging your code a lot easier.  The reason why im against a markup language or JSX or anything that sits on top of a technology is that it require tons more work from the platform. You can be happy composing Markup language for a UI, but you will have so many developers working on the platform crying and pulling hairs out to make it work for you. Another point of view is that JSX Worked for a Javascript community, Where as always its main objective is to make things easier for the developer and not worry about the tradeoffs. Don't get me wrong React(JSX) for web was a match made in heaven because HTML Is markup anyway. But for React Native look at all the code in the repository they had to do to make it work. Adding JSX to flutter would require tons of work and 2 things to think of when adding new features. And again just to be able to remove the child parameter and the const and new Keywords?. I prefer knowing what is really happening in the code and have control over what is happening than have magical Syntax that all its doing is add overhead.  Well that is my opinion. Don't want to start a new gigantic discussion. Just to mention the fact that JSX Is awesome for a react/javascript community because it worked for them, but for Dart/flutter i  find it a bit overkill to add JSX Just to attract developers from React Native.  Wow, could have written a blog post xD"
not_technical,"What is your previous experience with JSX, have you really used it or just looked at it? I think you guys are underestimating JSX by saying it will give small gains here and there. If you don't have any users, you don't have a product. I see lots of excitement about JSX here but nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain from having such a DSL, except perhaps some better readability which is mostly subjective.  More features usually only hog down a framework instead of improving it. Implementing them also consumes lots of resources that are missing from other areas where missing features actually prevent people from implementing certain applications.  So if you are excited about Flutter getting something like JSX, you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. Just adding something because others have it too, is probably the weakest argument there is.  There are also plans to improve Dart to make writing Flutter UI code less verbose which weakens the case for JSX even more.  So what are your convincing arguments?"
not_technical,"People can't use my experiments because it can't be seamlessly embedded right now into Flutter, so it remains an outside/online experiment where people can only see the potential. Can you be more specific timewise for when can we expect some movement on the build system changes to support preprocessing? Are we talking a month, a quarter, six month, a year, 2 years, a decade, a jubilee, etc Please read the top paragraphs of the JSX spec to see that there is no need to change the Dart language since JSX/DSX has no semantics, and it is not meant to be implemented by engines or incorporated into languages. It is intended to be used in a preprocessor (transpiler). DSX could be used with Flutter & on Web to make React-Dart exactly like React.js but with the Dart language. How can people use something that is not available for them to use in the first place and then conclude that nothing needs to be done because people are not using it ? This reminds me so much of Melissa McCarthy's Sean Spicer impersonation on SNL about the 'travel ban'... 'circular using of the word' Preprocessing capabilities are badly needed to enable experimentation. Without it nothing moves forward and you won't learn anything new. I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. For example, someone could easily write a shell script that wraps flutter run to do the preprocessing first, then call flutter run. I have a script myself that wraps hot reload to do something similar (I run the analyzer first, then only if it passes do I send the hot reload signal to the flutter script). Not really (see e.g. statement for why it might be difficult to make such statements), but probably not in the coming weeks. That's quite possible, indeed. I'm just saying that based on these experiments, we may reach any number of conclusions, all the way from ""do nothing"" to ""add radical new features to the language syntax"" and anything in between. The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments."
not_technical,"Ok this conversation has gone well beyond the kinds of discussions that we consider acceptable in the Flutter community, and so I'm going to lock this thread and close the bug. Please consider reading for more details on how we behave here.  The next step if anyone wants to contribute code to address this issue would be to come up with a design for how to do build system integration such that we can have code generation work with Gradle, Xcode, hot reload, and integration with existing apps. If anyone is interested in working on this, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Otherwise I expect this is something we'll work on early next year. Once we have a mechanism to do that, solutions like DSX will be easy to integrate into the Flutter ecosystem. We may even find solutions that should be integrated by default. In the meantime we're also working on improvements to Dart's syntax to see if we can make UI expressions even easier to write.  I would like to ask that people do not open new bugs on this topic unless there is something very constructive and new that is worth bringing up. It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. I mean add tiny syntactic sugar to enable XML like constructs inside dart code. It just makes code so much easier to read/develop/debug/maintain and also easier for powerful GUI builders to integrate with editable code.  Looking for something like DSX. The current issue with DSX is about proper integration with Flutter tools as to provide a great developer experience with debugger, auto-complete, etc. working on .dsx files.  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. If anybody wants to help, what I need is to figure out a way to add full preprocessing support (with source map) to Dart Tools and VS Code Dart plug in. Once the tools support that DSX or any other transpiling language (any language that is a superset of Dart but compiles everything down to Dart) would just work.  If you can and would like to help, let me know."
not_technical,"Also in the final XML processor I would avoid passing objects to attributes of parents and instead create child tags as below: Less boilerplate, you don't need to say it because it is inherited in the structure.

Also I'm not really sure it's less boilerplate.  Compare: It's not at all clear to me that the XML-ish syntax is cleaner or less boilerplatey. There's lots more punctuation, and some duplication of content (e.g. in the close tags). And you had to add some names, so sure, you lose ""child"", but you gain ""name"" on Icon.

What is it about ""declarative markup"" that is important to separate from ""code""?   Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. All your doubts have answered for it just learn more about how that was handled in JSX. I just don't have the time for this here.  As far as I can tell, JSX doesn't handle the things I was asking about. For example, React doesn't have the concept of child slots. The closest thing I could find is something they do by switching back to JS then back to JSX inside that, so you'd need to be able to parse both the programming language and the markup language. What I'm trying to understand is whether the same reasons that JSX is ""hot"" in React apply to Flutter.  Yes, the exact same thing applies here. The current way looks good to you because that's the only option you have. Give people a second option and the same will happen.  Whether E4X died or not is irrelevant because nothing lives forever. I have used ActionScript with E4X a lot and thought that Adobe did an excellent job there. In a way Flutter is just a newer version of Adobe Flash with Flex apps.   (I've been heavily involved in writing the specs for parsing HTML and been involved in similar work for XML, and I've implemented a parser for Dart, so I have a pretty good idea of how difficult parsing markup languages vs programming languages actually is.)  Great so you know that parsing a markup language is trivial compared to parsing an imperative programming language.   But why is it beneficial to be able to do that?  Code readability and simplicity which in turn drives a whole bunch of other benefits.   It's pretty obvious when scrolling through Flutter apps where the build functions are (they're the giant nested expressions). What is it about ""declarative markup"" that is important to separate from ""code""?  On your giant nested expressions can you easily see structure? can this structure be easily manipulated by other tools like GUI builders interchangebly ? I mean like Adobe Flex Builder use to do, drag and drop widgets around, wire them on UI and then switch to code view and just edit anything you want and then switch back to gui mode and continue to manipulate the widgets. You can't do that easily when the programmer goes inside your ""giant nested expressions"" and writes any valid dart code that doesn't follow the structure that the GUI editor is expecting. With a fixed XML structure that is not a problem.   As far as I can tell, JSX doesn't handle the things I was asking about. For example, React doesn't have the concept of child slots  It handles it just fine, you just don't know how to do it. So going forward just put the example in question here and I will provide you with what I think the JSX version should be.  It looks longer than the dart version but I could had placed everything in the same number of lines. Thing is an IDE/Editor can provide '+' & '-' to expand and collapse these XML nodes anyways.  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter."
not_technical,"Dude, you get a compliment from jstansbe which conveys a lot more information than a thumb up and you thumb down on the compliment?  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all.  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive.  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. So instead of doubling down just own it and I'll explain it in more detail. For example JSX & DSX only does the following 2 transforms (mentioned several times before):  Everything else is handled by the host language, so for example: how does it handle import of components named the same, answer: host language. I am not being dismissive, it is the way it is designed and the source of it's strength. You see if you separate markup and programming into separate files, you start to duplicate the programming inside the markup with simple constructs for 'if', etc. You end up building a declarative programming language inside the markup that can never be as powerful as the main programming language. So by bringing the markup into the programming language you have the best of both worlds and that's the power of JSX/DSX.  Notice above on (2) that the transform hardcoded <Widget and that's not always the case, so now you can specify that if needed as discussed before. Look at the transforms and now all symbols come from source or can be specified so there won't be some major magic gotchas in the future.  That's not true, you can have contrary opinion but you can't claim something true when I can proof otherwise. But that's the thing, I wanted the Flutter team to implement DSX but then I did it so what they need to implement is generic stuff that doesn't depend on DSX and DSX is not the only beneficiary. The browser js engine supports source maps which enabled an ecosystem of new languages in the browser that transpiled to js, it enabled the creation of Dart !!! and several others (Coffeescript, Typescript, Reason, etc). Dart could do the same now and benefit from the ecosystem that it helps bring up, all boats rise. I've already done it many times and the conclusion is that Plain Dart or DSX comes down to user preference, and the important thing is to provide option instead of forcing people one way.  I would use DSX because I prefer it, like spaces or tabs, type definition before or after the variable name. There is no point fighting for it, just accept that people have different preferences, there is more than 1 programming editor out there right?  Just your opinion, why do we use ""if"" statements in almost every language, 'for' statement, 'class', and now 'asyn/await'. Very good, now you gained my respect.  Thing is even if it gets closed again it won't stop people from asking for JSX-like capabilities. I have no ego but I do have short temper so there is no mistaking when someone pisses me off (it comes out right away). Not to offend you but your questions were not important. You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. You apparently didn't pick up on the sarcasm inherent in his comment. (He literally did everything I said not to do.) While a fun bit of trolling that I can appreciate, it's not appropriate here. And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness, but my point still stands - that kind of comment is  still  not appropriate here. Did my disclaimer in my very first comment on this thread perhaps tip you off?  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? While I've never worked on any serious React project, I've done my fair share of tinkering. I understand perfectly well how it  works . And that makes sense in the case where the markup language and the host language are distinct. With JSX, the markup language is designed as an  extension  of the host language. As such, JSX was designed as an extension of JS, and that's why it works as well as it does. DSX is an implementation of JSX for Dart.  You don't see the problem there? A markup language designed as an extension of one language being jerry-rigged into a foundationally different language. It is  inevitable  for there to be a load of issues, edge cases, and considerations. First, the whole idea behind separating markup and programming is that, if you are doing it correctly, there is a clear separation between the two which results in  no  duplication.  Secondly, if you are doing anything much more complex than ifs and fors in your UI code (which are constructs that can easily be handled in many markup solutions), then I would argue that it's a sign there is something wrong in your design anyway. As per MVC/MVVM design principles, if you are incorporating complex logic in your UI constructs, that's a potential sign of smelly code and you should seriously consider a redesign anyway.  (That's not to say that you  can't  write declarative UI in the MVVM fashion using JSX, but it's just something that invites trouble for little objective gain. Why use something in which you  can  write code that is standards-compliant when you can use something that makes it difficult to write code that  isn't ?) You haven't ""proved"" anything. You've given a bunch of subjective claims that have yet to be backed up with any substantiating logic. (Though to your credit, this latest post is a big improvement.)  You are still asking for them to do non-trivial stuff, so the onus is on you to convince them and the rest of us why they should and why it's so important that they should push down other things on their to-do list.  It is in the nature of JS itself that such a thing is easily doable (relatively speaking), so much so that Dart is far from the only language that has a transpiler to JS. As I have pointed out many times, Dart is not JS. It is static and strongly typed, meaning a lot of things that would be easy to do in JS are hugely complex in Dart.  By that logic, I should make a UI solution in which you define constructs using hex-encoded braille. I mean, if all that really matters is personal preference, all I need to say to defend its existence is that ""some people prefer it"", right?  You are developing a tool that you intend for other people to use, so you need reasoning beyond ""some people might like it"" to make yourself convincing. If you can't put it into words  why  they should use it over something else, then what makes you believe that they will? And what's there to incentivize you to  ensure  that they will when designing DSX's feature set?  First, those keywords (aside from async/await) became common programming lexicon because of the immense popularity of languages like C and BASIC over the course of several decades. As I've mentioned before, JSX is far from proven in its longevity - it's been around for 5 years and is yet to see any significant use outside of React despite the option being available.  Second, there's a big difference between familiarity and convention. if, while, for, struct, class, enum, try/catch/finally, async/await... those are all great ways to verbally represent a concept. There are reasons to defend using those keywords beyond them just being what people are familiar with - they make conceptual sense. (Of course, that doesn't mean that they are constants. Some languages do if ... then. Some do if ... elif while others do if ... else if and still others do if...endif. Some do foreach, others do from. And so on, and so forth.)  Meanwhile, the argument to use JSX because it is ""familiar"" doesn't fit the same category. JSX is one way to represent declarative UI, but it is neither the only one nor the most popular one. Furthermore, it was designed to be used in one type of environment, so using it in another environment can turn familiarity into a bad thing - familiarity leads them to expect it to work more or less exactly the same way it works elsewhere, so if it doesn't then that leads to a mental disconnect which is something that you want to  avoid .  They ask for it anyway, and the issue gets redirected here all the same. I don't see how the thread being closed would change that.  Read any book about product design. Chapter one is always about creating a statement, a manifesto, a slogan, anything tangible and expressible in plain English that describes what the product is and why people should care about it. There's a reason that the most common form of advice given to amateur entrepreneurs is to make an ""elevator pitch"", something that clearly and concisely communicates the product and the draw in 30 seconds or less. If you can't put it succinctly why people should use your product, it's a sign that it's suffering from an identity crisis. If the person designing the product can't adequately respond to criticism, then that gives the impression of a lack of faith in their own product. Both of those things are big red flags to investors.  In this situation, the product is DSX, and the investors are developers considering using it. The only people you have backing you are people who apparently would unconditionally cheer on anything with ""JSX"" in the description. Every other person in this thread I have seen question what you are doing has walked away seemingly unconvinced following your answer.  You are currently sitting at or near a 0% conversion rate, and  that's  where I'm coming from when I say that you have yet to adequately respond to criticism. Maybe you don't care, but if you seriously intend for DSX to be a UI declaration markup plugin usable and used in real-world projects, you might want to start.  But then again, maybe you are an exception."
not_technical,"And this, folks, is the real reason why the same group of vocals in this issue (not everyone, mostly those who take care to upvote each other) is against this proposal.  Let's be honest - this isn't about maintenance. None of you even assessed the maintenance cost, or made proposals to decrease it. This isn't about Yarn 1 either - you neither use it, nor recommend it. This isn't about bugs - you'd otherwise be at arms about some other things we won't list here. This isn't about community - you certainly didn't talk to Yarn's users, nor even cared about their opinion. This isn't about Node - it should be fairly obvious that shipping a project owned by a for-profit as part of a free software is a major red flag and liability. This isn't about package management ecosystem - otherwise you'd listen to those actually writing those package managers (you may have missed it, but I'm not even the only one - another ghost is lurking this thread as well). This isn't whatever reason you want to make people believe it is, folks.  What this is is that you believe that modern npm is as good as Yarn, and you don't see how this proposal would do you any good. To you, Yarn should die a fiery death to give back npm all its glory, and you have many amazing ideas to make that happen. It's fine, we all have opinions. I'm more an Emacs user myself, but whatever. The problem is that this, quite literally, isn't the discussion at hand. Right here, right now, we're talking about the existing state of the ecosystem.  For the better or worse, whether you like it or not, Yarn is used. That's it. It's really not up to you (or me) to decide whether its users are right or wrong. The very fact that they use it means it matters. To block this proposal because, to you, ""npm is as good"" would be at best egoistical, at worst worrying meddling (not only would Node tolerate a for-profit project, it would actively fight for it, do you still want to laugh at Deno?). Frankly, the question really isn't ""should Node add Yarn"" - it's rather ""can Node prone inclusivity by persisting in providing a subpar developer experience to a specific set of people, depending on the tool they use?"".  As a side note, out of the 1000 most depended packages on the npm registry, 216 definitely use Yarn, and 291 use npm (the rest being undeterminable). Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"
not_technical,"Node.js collaborators also come and go, it wouldn't be fair for us current collaborators to make a decision for future collaborators. Also, future collaborators will have more information (hopefully) than we have today, I trust them to make the correct call when the time comes. By a lot of regards, Node.js as it is today is based on trust, I agree that doesn't always work, but as it's written in capital letters in our license file: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. FWIW decision hasn't been made yet, it has been discussed in TSC meetings and TSC members will vote to decide what is the status of Yarn in Node.js. I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, ""making future decisions based on trust is a mistake"", while other people may not (I don't). I don't think this achieves the goal of improving the experience for beginners, it just makes it confusing (why are there two package managers that are compatible with one another?) It also makes node.js look confused: why should a distribution ship with two COMPETING package managers?"
not_technical,"That's not justification for being bundled in Node.js, imo. I can understand where you're coming from here, but this sounds like a pitch to me. It feels like justification of decisions without crediting the potential trade-offs or drawbacks of those decisions.  There's so much to deconstruct in this bit so rather than doing it in paragraphs, I'm going to try to summarize in bullets:  * ""It has its flaws"" there are bug reports and PRs to patch them that are going unmerged. This is a very... simple and kind way to frame this. * ""People using Yarn 1.x right now have a project that already works."" People using pnpm, bower, or jspm also have projects that work. If they're already using it and have a workflow that works for them, why do we need to include Yarn in Node.js? Why is yarn different from those other package managers? * ""They may hit edge cases every once in a while, but the whole reason they use it is that they mostly figured out that the tradeoff was still value-positive for their current project."" Same point as above. If they're already using it and have a workflow around that, what is the reason to add it to Node.js? * ""Being frozen is a feature, it's a gift that we are giving."" Framing a decision you've made as a ""gift"" implies that the recipient should be grateful. If they're not, that sets them up to be the villain. Frankly, I don't really think this framing has a space in this PR nor, honestly, to our users. * ""It means that existing users won't get accidental regressions or bugs. Yarn is about stability, and putting our users in control."" How is this different than permanently pinning to a package manager version across a company? I can use the first-ever published version of Yarn and expect the same, just like I can for npm, pnpm, Bower, or jspm. * ""You shouldn't need to upgrade just because we release something new."" Wasn't your previous assertion that you're only going to be doing security releases from now on?  I am entirely familiar with the arguments around projects being ""done"" and feature complete. I think that those reasons are entirely fine within userland. Where I think we need to be more critical of that is when we're committing it into Node.js in a way that is effectively irrevocable. Again, if they already have the tool why are we putting it in Node.js core? Doing so would  force  them to change their existing workflows - including involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version - which seems to be antithetical to the stated goals of Yarn. I don't think you understand this diff, or how Yarn is distributed. All versions of Yarn act both as a package manager and a jumper (similar, if you will, to gulp-cli). If it finds a yarnPath entry in .yarnrc.yml, it will use it instead of the global one. In other words, older projects will use Yarn 1 (because that's the global version used as fallback when nothing is found), or the checked-in package manager if it finds the right configuration to do so. Put simply, everyone gets what they ask for. There is no ""involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version"". On the other hand, it does require *a* Yarn to be globally available.  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. At this point I don't know what to tell you. That's answered."
not_technical,"That's just not how the Node.js project works, all updates, as any change, need to go through a code review process. In the case of npm for example, we usually defer to members of npm who are also Node.js collaborators to review a PR updating the npm version bundled with Node.js. If this PR lands, I would expect that we would follow the same process: deferring reviews of PRs updating the bundled yarn version to members of the Yarn project who are also Node.js collaborators. So it is in fact a trust system between Yarn and Node.js. Thank you for expressing your concern, I think you made your point, please stop bringing it up so we can keep the discussion in this thread productive. I will happily stop.

not_technical,"Also note that my goal here is to easen the contribution workflow for projects already using Yarn (so that anyone cloning them can start working with them without having to install Yarn). This implies two things:  - It has to be Yarn 1 by design, because that's what those projects already use (Yarn 2 projects check-in the package manager, so they have no need for a Yarn 2 global binary - Yarn 1 works just fine for this purpose). - It shouldn't change significantly how those projects work. Indeed, projects that use Yarn **now** use it because it works. As such, making fixes is more likely to break something than to improve their situation (it won't surprise you that any fix comes with its own risks in terms of regression).  You'll note that this reasoning is also why we switched to a model where Yarn 2 is installed by-project rather than globally. We simply acknowledge that it's a dependency, like any other, and as such that it should be locked like any other. The npm install model (that Yarn 1 inherited) is rather unfortunate in that it merrily upgrades package managers at the same time as you upgrade Node, and this is not something we want to happen in our case. We believe that updates must be controlled, and left at the discretion of the user. Hence why we intend to remain conservative on the Yarn 1 trunk (unlike Yarn 2, where users are in full control of their migrations). Thank you for the clarification it helps a lot, and does make me feel better. My concern was because I saw PRs to Yarn 1 being closed because the build breaking bugs fixed by them were addressed in Yarn 2. I don't expect you to drop everything and have core members continue patching Yarn 1. However, I would expect you to continue to accept community provided fixes for outstanding problems. I get the desire not to do this, and as a stand alone project I thought you were totally justified in just saying ""no, we've moved on"". But as something that's going to be bundled with Node and expand the core ecosystem I would expect more I guess."
not_technical,"It's not a misconception, it's how almost all software projects treat their dependencies. You will absolutely get issues filed to upgrade Yarn from users who will just assume that it's part of the plan.  Yarn 2 not being on the table today is not enough, it has to be explicitly off the table in the future. The harm to the ecosystem (and Node itself) is to great to invite in Yarn 1 as a trojan horse without such a commitment. That's what I previously meant by this trust thing. Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling ""we can't trust them they're the devil in disguise"". I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. Again, we opened this PR because we saw a way to improve Node by this partnership, and we went with it. We certainly don't have anything tangible to gain from it, except an increased maintenance load. If the response is for a set of people to feel justified in harassing a project, let me say I'm disappointed."
not_technical,"Which peer dep RFC are you referring to? (peer deps have always been semantically required, for example, but i'm not sure if that's what you're referring to) This isn't the time nor place to have this debate with you once more. You're incorrect, and I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it."
not_technical,"Which peer dep RFC are you referring to? (peer deps have always been semantically required, for example, but i'm not sure if that's what you're referring to) What will the planned future of the Yarn v1 be? Every project, which was once feature freezed, is to be sunset. There is v2 and there may be  v3, etc. The time will come when the user group is very small or 0. Do you have any metrics which shows the trend of the v1 usage?  Node.js has a release calendar that makes changes planable. A lifetime plan for Yarn v1 is needed too, specially in the current case when it can be one of the elements of the Node.js installer.  Honestly, I would like to remove it from the official docker images, too. The time will come when the question is raised: - keep Yarn v1 and add v2 to the docker image - replace Yarn v1 with v2 Sorry for the extra topic I just wanted to highlight this question, too."
not_technical,"My main concern about Yarn v1 is that bugs are now being closed as ""fixed in v2"" which is not what you do in a maintained major version. These kinds of bugs are complete show stoppers for some private registries. Shipping an unupdatable version of Yarn as an unchanging artifact in Node leaves Node permanently broken. Bugs happen, but there needs to be some process through which they can be fixed. If this really was just a feature freeze, I would be less concerned, but as can be seen from the issue and associated PR, that's not how it's playing out on the ground. I would also add that the ecosystem needs to be able to add features to package management systems. Blessing a package manager that can't receive feature updates would reduce the ability for the Node community to adapt to changes. For instance, there's the open npm RFC to add registry dependencies -- if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers still under development, it would be very uncomfortable for Node itself to be shipping with one that didn't support it. Which is a very interesting example, thanks for bringing that up. The RFC you're talking about has received strong objections from both Yarn and pnpm - objections which from what transpire from the issue don't plan to be addressed. In other words, npm being the only package manager is already putting the ecosystem at risk (at least under their current handling of RFCs). Also note that this isn't a unique occurence - in fact, it already happened a few months ago with npm 7, which tried to change how peer dependencies are semantically defined. Just like now, the RFC received early and strong pushback from both Yarn and pnpm (and other projects), but the RFC author decided to ignore them and go with it. The lack of package managers diversity (and thus neutrality) is a problem. The role of the Node TSC is to find a solution. This PR (along with others) is a way to do that. If you have a better one go for it? I don't mind seeing competing ideas."

Secondly, literally none of the hooks related to the chat system cover my mod's use case, where: * The mod does not have to be installed on the client * Users can individually choose to opt out of the chat censor using a command * The censor also censors messages sent by systems that the user can type input to, such as the names of claimed territories in Clans, Towny, Factions, etc, to help ensure there is no way around it  I would not have put in the effort to make a coremod in the first place if any of the hooks were able to do this. There is both a ServerChatEvent and a ClientChatEvent, they should address the bulk of what you need. A 10 second look would of shown you that. And do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now.  Also this PR would never be accepted because we do not encourage people to directly screw with packets at the  raw level like this. IF it was to EVER be entertained it would have to be hooked in the correct places where the data is actually sent like ServerChatEvent is and have the proper context. If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break."
not_technical,"If you're looking for ""rancorous sniping and harmful drama"" you might try using a mirror. Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story."
not_technical,"Those questions are relevant to the thread. Read the title of the thread.  Edit: Since some people like mAAdhaTTah don't seem to understand the relevance of the questions, here is the relevant part of the title: ""Open an RFC to discuss decision to ... remove Jamie""  If you can't answer the questions, that's answer enough for this thread. I disagree that this is very clear:  ""the impact of this change was almost 100% negative, with no appreciable progress toward the ostensible goal aside from rancorous sniping and harmful drama.""  The claims made here are not supported by evidence or arguments.  This was the plural ""you"" here, as in ""you, the maintainers."" In any case, I still don't understand why Jamie's dismissal was linked as part of the same announcement, clearly implying that his dismissal had to do with his introduction of the modified MIT license.  Respectfully, given the conflict of interest between your role as a maintainer and your role as a Microsoft employee, I think you should have sat out of that decision. It certainly appears to many as though your loyalty to your employer influenced the revert back to the old license."
not_technical,"Calls for ""civility"" and ""cooling down"" are invariably intended to cease discussion, not enhance it. Hannah's right - the time to discuss is now. If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. Please let everyone know with advance notice so they can make preparations to move away from it if it's going to become proprietary software."
not_technical,"this is transparently absurd. You can't just say ""I'm not influenced by the company who pays me"" and thus make it so. I sometimes laugh at the Twitter refrain of ""tech workers need to be trained in ethics,"" but perhaps it's true. If you're looking for ""rancorous sniping and harmful drama"" you might try using a mirror."
not_technical,"I see these as two separate issues. If the community and the maintainers want to use a modified MIT license, that is fully within their right. However, Jamie's behavior was plainly abusive and in violation of the CoC. Jamie's removal was a necessity and shouldn't be open for debate. Blocking people from contributing because they disagreed, which eventually lead to him blocking everyone but contributors, attacking companies/individuals, claiming community tools (like Babel) are ""his"" is overwhelming evidence that he violated the CoC.  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to ""be nice"" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however.  As for this issue, TheLarkInn made it pretty clear that they'd like to wait for the dust to settle prior to a formal RFC. That makes sense. Right now Lerna is a target for people only interested in politics, and once the dust settles they will likely have something new to chase, and the people actually interested in the project can contribute to the suggested RFC."
not_technical,"your implication that commenters have no relation to Lerna is unsubstantiated. I for one am actively involved in the ecosystem surrounding Lerna and have been preparing to add Lerna to a project I maintain, although I am now considering alternative options. Let's test if that's the actual goal (Emphasis added by me) I could probably stop here. That's enough for removal. Full stop.  * Blocking people on the lerna repository that politely called him out. * Blocking all non-contributors on the repo from posting issues/comments/PR's  * Suggesting he may not do a major version bump  This is in addition to his horrible conduct in every issue posted regarding adding his company restrictions to the MIT license. That's pretty transparent. That's pretty objectively trolling, personal attacks and insults. Now the question is, do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight?"
not_technical,"as I said perhaps he made some unfortunate statements - what I'm trying to say is that if you look at the license change PR where he elaborated, it does not look like he thinks he personally owns the project at the exclusion of anybody else. He did not push the change without review. When people say ""my"" thing, it can mean a lot of different things - its usually not helpful to draw strong conclusions from the use of that word.  Looking at the commit history, it does look like he was heavily involved in the early days of Lerna. I assume he means ""my"" in a similar sense - ""Lerna is a project which I was heavily involved in and I share significant responsibility for creating"". Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies SRGOM :)"
not_technical,"no I said for people who are against the change being reverted to look at the fact that they are using MS products -- which makes them hypocrites. If you want to boycott Microsoft, maybe don't use their products -- or even better get off of GitHub. I'm not even sure what you said -- to be honest I stopped reading it after the first sentence. So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that..."
not_technical,"I would agree if this were the actual RFC thread, but this is actually just a thread requesting an RFC should exist in the first place. Therefore I don't think it's valid to judge peoples' comments here as what they would have said in an actual RFC.  And yet the reason we have OSS licenses as a staple of modern software development today was the continued preaching of outcast mailing list users in the last few decades, and you could extend this to basically any successful political protest as well. There's also lots of not OSS software that is free as in beer. And I appreciate that this is true, but being ""non-OSS"" would not preclude this from happening by default anyway.  And yet Stallman's own license is one of the most restrictive and closed-door OSS licenses there is. He just closes the door on a different group of people: the group of people that want to use or modify his code without sharing back their changes. There's not a fundamental difference between that and precluding groups for another reason. This is also why I think the OSI page on ""evil"", originated from the JSON license, is fairly crap. I think the ""do no evil line"" is also terrible because it's even less enforceable than what the MIT-ICE license was, but the discussion in OSS around being able to preclude wrongdoers from using code has been very backwards IMO.  As I said, Lerna's own license change is not meant to harm ICE by itself in any significant way, it's meant to  1. Deal with the ethical concerns of allowing a harmful entity to use your code 2. Show other OSS projects that this is a real dilemma and hopefully spark them to discuss and maybe take the same action  If many OSS projects do the same thing, then there could be real, large-scale change over time.  None of those show a trollish intent behind the action at all, and in the actual PR that was made, the changes were discussed in a very professional manner, all (at the time available) protocols were followed, and a calm and deliberate reasoning was given. Being terse and (arguably) rude to companies over their using tools he contributed to does not constitute the action being trollish. Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy.   If you just excuse it as ""unfortunate"" then you're just trying to justify your own opinions.  The difference between having a strict license vs claiming it's open. As I said numerous times, if the goal is to have lerna be proprietary that's a different discussion. At the current time, and as far as I know, lerna plans to stay as an *open* source project. Then none of them are open source anymore. You have collectively made a proprietary license. We're not arguing that so it's a moot point to even mention. He made multiple issues in the same project that all state the same thing, linking to the same resources which are there to incite hatred from a group of people towards a company. See this definition: My god, it's exactly what he did."
not_technical,"Go has gaps on Windows, I plug them in my code. You've seen the interest this issue evoked :-p. What you need isn't hard. Create a file named yourpkg windows.go, import, define GetCanonicalPath() to call CreateFile(""yourfile"") (to get a handle) then Get Final Path Name By Handle. Create a file yourpkg unix.go with a  +build directive for your unix platforms. Define GetCanonicalPath() with the solution for unix you already know. First of all, I appreciate that you're trying to help.  However, I do feel firmly that this functionality should be in the standard library, since it is in almost every other language, and it is in POSIX.  I don't want to carry a lot of platform-specific code in a program because it's difficult to maintain and test, especially when I don't typically develop on Windows.  If Go is known to have known defects on Windows, those should be promptly fixed or clearly documented.  For many purposes, it's fine if code doesn't run or run well on Windows, but there are some cases where it does.  The documentation should clearly and prominently list any limitations with using Go on Windows so that folks can make an informed decision.  Last I checked, the filepath documentation didn't indicate such limitations, and hasn't for some time.  Normally, when I find a bug or missing feature, I would send a patch to implement that functionality.  However, Go has a CLA, and I don't sign CLAs, so any patch I might submit wouldn't be accepted.  If that changes, I'm happy to send a patch to implement this properly if nobody gets to it before me."

That's not what's happening here, and I'm sure you had only good intent to move the discussion forward in a productive way, but since we often lack all the context to know people's reasons for blocking others, it's generally best not to ask.  For the limited purpose of advancing this proposal, I have unblocked ericwj for the moment.  I'm fine with Canonical() or Canonicalize() as a name since it's used elsewhere.

First off, I don't see how this could be an issue if you are having docs per version (docs for 1.11, docs for 1.12, and so on), and secondly, what is strings.Builder and do we really need it? Are we going to have strings.Factory, too? For a moment I thought go is finally taking a better route, but it makes me reconsider that thought. On another note, yes, I agree with Rob here. Inconsistency has been a problem for go, it just seems like people come and write completely different and random examples to similar, related functions. That's not how it should be done. Apparently Rob had to assign it to himself, and tell others to stop posting examples for this reason. Thanks Rob, this chaotic madness needs to stop. Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date.

not_technical,"Yargs has been configured with .strict() for almost two years now). It appears Yargs 14 fixes some bugs that were previously obscuring it. For every version prior to 3.18.x ""only applies to"" meant ""is ignored otherwise"". Now it means ""breaks your build"". That's not SemVer minor. I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. Minor versions of lerna should not break my build."
not_technical,"while I agree in principle clearly this was not evocateur fault but an underlying package.  It's not fair to put the blame on him. And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude.  Relax, I get the frustration, but let's be civil. Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be. I was quite polite until I was asked to be thankful for my builds breaking without warning. Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response."
not_technical,"When exactly did I say that?  * If you're not using a lockfile, then the only one to blame for your builds breaking ""without warning"" is yourself. * If you  are  using a lockfile, then it was an explicit change you made (upgrading lerna) that caused the breakage, not a dastardly plan on my part to cause you pain.  The fact remains that the long-standing  intention  of lerna's argument parsing was to be strict, throwing errors when unrecognized options were passed. There was a bug in yargs 12 that silently perverted this intention, and yargs 14 fixed it. I'd say that's much worse than sounds like you did me a favor, but all I got was extra work.   The whole point of SemVer is that this ""explicit change"" can be made by a machine. The author of a library categorized upgrades into breaking and non-breaking. Software like renovate can then pick certain updates and apply them automatically based on this categorization.  The condescending attitude aside, a lockfile alone does not help here. Updating lerna necessarily means my lockfile changes. My direct usage of yargs was ""protected"" by the lockfile, because the selector yargs12.0.1 still gave me 12.0.5 at node modules/yargs/. But without forced hoisting (and thus forced conflict resolutions) that has no impact on what is in node modules/lerna/node modules/yargs/ I am not saying you planned this. Your update broke something for some consumers without being SemVer major. That is unfortunate, but it's a mistake that can happen. However, your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. You could have said ""sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0"" and it would be fine. You could have said ""sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build."
not_technical,"And SemVer doesn't care if breaking my build now is ""better"" than silent errors, it only cares about compatibility. lerna 3.18.x is not compatible to 3.17.x. If lerna does not want to do SemVer, than at the very least you should put a warning into your readme and possibly switch to version numbers that do not suggest SemVer, so consumers know not to let renovate auto-update this dependency.

This is a consistency thing. It's in the same vein of why Godot has a contributors style guide. Because anything that reduces the cognitive load on a developer is a good thing and consistency does that. Now personally I don't see how primitives are special to GDScript users, but dalexeev has done a better job covering that than I did. For the last time: YES, they are a ""special type of type"".

not_technical,"Exactly. Bgfx is being used in production by renowned studios to deploy cross-platform products. So it's reasonably battle-tested and I don't see any compelling reason not to take advantage of that, not to mention the API is very well designed too. Angle isn't a good option if you care about performance. Guys, thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. I've been working on 3D rendering for 25 years so, if I am telling you that things as they are now are optimal and BGFX will just stand in the way to being productive I hope you believe me.  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it.  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free.  If not, keep pestering all you want and it will be ignored."
not_technical,"Please refrain from talking negatively about bgfx when you justifying your strategic decision about Godot, since there is really no animosity between two projects. Both are open source, have their own place, and not even competitors...  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements.  There are two main platforms that need to be supported. Modern Desktop PC (OpenGL ES 3, and later Vulkan) and mobile including medium and low end (OpenGL ES 2). These APIs are not programmed the same way, so a ""wrapper"" to simplify the work is impossible. GLES3/Vulkan uses UBOs, VAOs, TBOs. shaders with integers and plenty of features. GLES2 is very basic and supports none of that, so different approaches need to be used to write a back end.  Example of this actually exist in bgfx code base. Since bgfx is declarative API not imperative, you can actually write code that works optimally on two completely different APIs.   Modern hardware also uses certain rendering techniques (HDR/clustered/single pass shading),  while low end uses other techniques (LDR/multipass). As such, being a fact that pretty much no code is shared between backends, BGFX does not save the work of having to write two backends for different hardware.  You're talking here about two different rendering pipelines, not two different renderers. Yes with bgfx too you have to implement two different pipelines to support your low-end hardware and high-end hardware. The difference is, when you use bgfx that both pipelines are avilable on all renderers. Which means that you can enable your low-end pipeline for desktop users who have old HW/OS/etc. and you can enable your high-end pipeline for mobile users who have beefy phone/table. This is actually nonsensical statement. When you debug rendering issues in bgfx with for example RenderDoc, PIX, or GPA, you see underlying API and they are not getting confused with bgfx. Not really, since bgfx is not low-level renderer. If you just want to use single renderer in bgfx, and you don't care about cross-platform and feature parity between renders it's as fast to add features to single renderer with bgfx too. I never said anything negative about BGFX itself, only in the context of Godot.  The point of the discussion was mainly that, given two render pipelines need to be written anyway, using BGFX is not an advantage or solution regarding to that. You answers completely missed it.  For the other answers, I was not questioning whether BGFX was high or low level, or whether it can be debugged, or anything else. The point was simply that  it is  added complexity (which is undeniable) for an use case that is redundant and provides no advantages ** in the context of Godot **. As this added complexity does not solve our problems, there is no justification to going for it.  Apologies, but I think you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX."
not_technical,"The point was simply that it is added complexity (which is undeniable) for an use case that is redundant and provides no advantages in the context of Godot. As this added complexity does not solve our problems, there is no justification to going for it.  This is what I'm talking about. You're saying that bgfx would add complexity into your code base, but it's actually quite oposite, by using bgfx it removes complexity from usual code base. Once someone replaces their own renderer with bgfx, they usually have redundant code on higher level, they don't have to do state tracking anymore since bgfx deals with that, they don't have to do multiple passes over scene because bgfx allows you to submit out of order and orders draw calls for you, etc. But bgfx is complex on it's own.  In the past you made statements that you want to control whole stack, and you don't want to introduce risk by adding 3rd party open source software. I find this is more honest response, since there is nothing that I can add or remove from bgfx that would make you reconsider your strategy about renderer. So no need to justify your decision about renderer by saying bgfx does or doesn't do X, Y, Z, if your decision was unrelated to bgfx as you stated before. It definitely  is  complexity. You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work.  This is, unfortunately not the case and how things work in real life. This may work for APIs or libraries where you truly no longer need to care how internal implementations of things work as long as they do what they have to. Bullet is a good example of this.  However, in my experience, if we were to use BGFX, contributors would still need to also know the underlying APIs as well (OpenGL or Vulkan). How else are they supposed to fine tune performance, or understand why something fails when it does?  If this was a simple game, or a tool or something like that I am sure BGFX would be fine, but thinking BGFX will fit like a glove for us and just work is very naive. We have a lot more responsibility than you do at providing something that works for our users. We need to extract the best out of the resources and performance from the underlying hardware, since we are already a middle layer ourselves.  So, as I already made it pretty clear that there is no advantage to it, due to us needing two rendering pipelines, and that contributors will still need to understand the underlying rendering APIs. I hope you understand that to me it's just extra unnecessary complexity that is best kept away of Godot."
not_technical,"this was exactly the kind of answer I was aiming for, thanks. Please refrain from talking negatively about bgfx when you justifying your strategic decision about Godot, since there is really no animosity between two projects. Both are open source, have their own place, and not even competitors...  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements.  There are two main platforms that need to be supported. Modern Desktop PC (OpenGL ES 3, and later Vulkan) and mobile including medium and low end (OpenGL ES 2). These APIs are not programmed the same way, so a ""wrapper"" to simplify the work is impossible. GLES3/Vulkan uses UBOs, VAOs, TBOs. shaders with integers and plenty of features. GLES2 is very basic and supports none of that, so different approaches need to be used to write a back end.  Example of this actually exist in bgfx code base. Since bgfx is declarative API not imperative, you can actually write code that works optimally on two completely different APIs.   Modern hardware also uses certain rendering techniques (HDR/clustered/single pass shading),  while low end uses other techniques (LDR/multipass). As such, being a fact that pretty much no code is shared between backends, BGFX does not save the work of having to write two backends for different hardware.  You're talking here about two different rendering pipelines, not two different renderers. Yes with bgfx too you have to implement two different pipelines to support your low-end hardware and high-end hardware. The difference is, when you use bgfx that both pipelines are avilable on all renderers. Which means that you can enable your low-end pipeline for desktop users who have old HW/OS/etc. and you can enable your high-end pipeline for mobile users who have beefy phone/table. This is actually nonsensical statement. When you debug rendering issues in bgfx with for example RenderDoc, PIX, or GPA, you see underlying API and they are not getting confused with bgfx. Not really, since bgfx is not low-level renderer. If you just want to use single renderer in bgfx, and you don't care about cross-platform and feature parity between renders it's as fast to add features to single renderer with bgfx too."
not_technical," Hello, I am trying to build myself home NAS with old Atom mini-ITX board... So i install OMV5, i plug in dad's old NTFS drive... and here we go... Frankly, i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. So any hacker which for whatever reason would change it - would be instantly notifie on old pending bugs.  Salt seems extremely fragile here, probably no one else except for OMV5 uses it for partitions. Maybe OMV6 could do it outside Salt? Like good old UDEV rules or anything. I mean, before Salt porject might decide to drop this functionality that almost no one use, instead of burden of maintaining it for OMV5 alone.... Well, ranting aside, i am rather puzzled with your  device. Where do you even get this hex substitution from??? Thing is, the whole mounting escaping is one uber-ancient legacy mess. Putting it here so maybe someone would use it. I spent like 3 hours googling around and experimenting with Python that i never used before. Tryied to google some standard about Posix/Linux/bash filename mangling/escaping.... and then Python module to undo it. To no avail.  Okay, so, to document it down. - mtab/fstab and friends is one-of-a-kind ancient mess. - it started with ancient BSD (not FreeBSD) function strunvis, which behaviour  not documented. Probably that was OS-specific function (a la virtual methods).  - when Linux was mimicking good old BSd it only made ad hoc substitutions for 4 specific chars. There is no any systematic/generic pattern at all.  So, whatever comes from Linux mounts information - should be de-mangled for those four special cases. Every single space-separated column of every single line. Ugly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...  BUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that??? Linux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts. Now, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with ""DATA"" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk! Again, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but... What gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition? Seems whatever use cases Salt imagined for them here is very different from what OMV users might face."
not_technical,"i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... I am coming to believe that, while never documented, the intention of that Salt module was to always use fstab-like escaped strings for all their IDs. If not, i would like to see specific calls into other Salt modules, which expect different convention for disk names. I really did quite a number of changes to de-escape \040 and other special chars. And probably that was only breaking things.  Except for one place though, which i believe should be patched. Would you keep implementation non-patched and would you call salt-call mount.list mounts - you would see the mount point broken, cut off on the first space. This was probably THE bug.  Okay, keeping my stolen Linux archeologist hat on. So, it is UDEV or SYSTEMD which creates those weird hex-mangled names. Okay. Though putting them into this still feels wrong. man mount suggests against it and suggests using UUID=... and LABEL=... flags instead. Now back to your example. I don't know what it should mean in specific files/commands terms. But i feel this is the error on OMV part. And perhaps lack of documentation/understanding/forecasting on Salt part. My inner archeologist says that the name AKA mount point AKA target directory is meant to be in bash-mangled format. IOW OMV should had created ""\ "" containing fileneames: Linux man mount also suggests against the second option due to ambiguity, where the single parameter is mount point name or device file name. I don't know if other UNIX-likes but Linux support those precision keys.  --source device If only one argument for the mount command is given  then  the argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device).  This option allows to explicitly  define  that  the argument is the mount source. --target directory If  only  one argument for the mount command is given then the argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source (device).   This  option  allows to explicitly define that the argument is the mount target. So i think that part in def mount should better be written as this. I don't think this is the right place to discuss OMV related things. Escaping blanks is not my idea, it is used by every userland command that processes mount points, e.g. mount. Either systemd want to have escaped paths in mount units too, there is a special command to convert paths for you, see systemd-escape. OMV already workarounds this issue, thus it is not affected by this reported issue here. I don't think Salt will drop mount.mounted because it is a somewhat essential functionality of Linux systems. You can do that, but don't blame the software then. Using USB devices in a NAS is no good idea, but that's a different thing. IMO devices using in a NAS should be already connected to the NAS, no plug-and-play, this is not how a NAS is intended to work. If devices are always connected, then you will never run into the situation that duplicate labels might harm your system. This issue is user introduced and should be handled by them. If you want to discuss this issue please open an issue in the OMV Git repository."
not_technical,"re: escaping names for calling mount - i think that is what was intended to do so. but that was only called when from then Extended is set to True, if ever. And similar code inside. So it seems Salt prefers to keep space-containing names mangled, but mangled differently. So, no escaping when calling mount or umount is needed. I am not even sure that de-escaping mount point in Salt would be correct way to go. There can be a point: since that module serves as abstraction layer and should hide UNIX-likes peculiarities from generic Salt modules, all IDs better be unmangled. But not sure. However IF to do this de-mangling, then quoting arguments for calling mount becomes required indeed. But anyway, this line i believe  should not had ended in /etc/fstab and whoever added it was at fault... i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them...

not_technical,"I think it is ok to use systemd escaped paths in this since systemd handles filesystem mounting nowadays. i mentioned systemd because of this. See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) But i am glad to hear from you.  So, how can we scratch this itch, is Salt team is not with us on it... Can you make some scripts demonstrting the alleged Salt bug that i could run from bash ? Also are there some hidden option in OMV5 to re-enable mounting space-containing partitions?"
not_technical,"And now the most curious thing to me. I changed the partition label, then i mounted the disk from OMV Web UI ....and there is no any space-containing mountpoint path regardless of partition label. The ""workaround"" seems to needlessly shoot down the perfectly working function! Maybe it is only with MBR/NTFS disks, maybe GPT or XFS disks would use something else in fstab, dunno. it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. Salt users would not suffer from it. OMV users would. Demanding PR from OMV users like me is funny when you did not make any PR to Salt, or maybe i am wrong and you did.  So, back to this: The intention was and is to make OMV work with disks users insert.Without forcing them to go ssh sudo. So simple. You make it look that making OMV ""just work"" is bad goal. Because that woul be consistent with bash/Salt data format. But i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. Some we are on the same page here. You blaze of ego is called for.  Since eysterday i was asking you to show me at the seams between OMV and Salt, the exact borderleines, didn't i? I am glad you seem to did so above. And when i showed those links, i commented upon them. Salt is based on Python, not PHP. The code you're ranting about never runs in the Salt context. I never said so. Both Salt and OMV are ""black boxes"" with some data exchange. And i was asking you to point me to the raw places of exchange and raw data being exchanged, didn't i? Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine.  That Example SLS: - many times from yesterday i asked you how can i reproduce this activity from bash command line. You kind of answered by showing PHP code for SLS generation - after many requests and hours. But you still not answered how to trigger that action from bash. I asked you yesterday how to make OMV code trigger that action of Salt, allegedly buggy Salt. And you refused to help me doing it. What can i patch in OMV5 to make this notification gone? Why do you want to know that? What do you expect to improve? You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. You are blocking any attempt to debug OMV and Salt interaction - and you demand perfectly polished PRs. It is not consistent. And it is would not help anyone. Not me, not you, not OMV users."

And it is not there anymore and it did not come back, but the PowerShell option is still in the menu when I open the terminal program and when I click it, a tab opens with Powershell.   I have closed and reopened both the profiles.json file and Windows Terminal several times and it's not in the profiles.json file and it IS in the menu in Windows Terminal.  I then added ""Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore"" to the disabledprofilesources  mentioned previously and the PowerShell option is still in the menu.  Then I renamed the profiles.json file to profiles.json.bak and reran Windows Terminal to see if it would regenerate the entire config file and it did so, creating a much sparser file than existed before with no keybinding information or color schemes.  I then added the profiles I had created before to the profiles.json and set the default and added the disabledprofilesources option for Azure Cloud and now everything is as it should be.  We now return to your regularly scheduled program.  additional.  Curiouser and curiouser. I did the alt-click-settings to view the default settings file and it shows me a file that DOES include the keybindings and color schemes.  The file it generated after I deleted the profiles.json did NOT include keybindings and color schemes.  Windows Terminal (Preview) Version: 0.5.2762.0"
not_technical," Hi - I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. There are a lot of other folks that we are supporting at the same time as you, and we are responding as fast as we can. Please know that we aren't ignoring you, nor are we happy to close your issues and never respond. Please have patience with us while we try to assist you and others. Thanks  I'm happy to make a temporary fix to support the two parameter method for this third party plugin using an internal library to Vagrant, but as I mentioned yesterday you will likely get more traction and a quicker fix if you open an issue on the plugin side and fix it there. Our Vagrant release cadence isn't too frequent, and there are lots of other issues and features that we're trying to get in for each release.  If you wish to get this moving faster, there is already a pull request on the plugin. I recommend pinging the maintainer on there.  For fixing this today on your side, you should still be able to use the built in rsync synced folder feature, as this is the recommended way to use rsync and Vagrant. Alternatively, downgrading to Vagrant 2.2.5 and using that plugin until a fix has been met is also a possibility. You could also bring in the changes locally and run and install the plugin from source.  We can leave this open to track the issue for now in case others find it. If our next release time comes around and it's still not fixed on their side, I'll apply a patch that fixes this so that it works in 2.2.7. Thanks!"

not_technical,"I suffer the same problem also  My connection on speedtest.net 6.6Mbps while the download takes only 0.6 Mbps of my bandwidth Hi everyone,  This issue overall is very complicated in that it is not easily reproducible and is very dependent on location, network health, and the actual download location of the target box. In many cases the box being downloaded is located on a third party system. One feature that was introduced in Vagrant a couple releases ago was the notification of redirect to show when boxes are being downloaded from a third party server.  There have also been claims that the embedded curl is downloading files slower than the system curl. I have not been successful in validating this claim and do not see a difference in download speed between my system curl and the embedded curl. However, as of Vagrant 2.0.4, the VAGRANT PREFER SYSTEM BINS environment variable is available for all platforms. When enabled, Vagrant will use local system binaries if available instead of the embedded binaries. If you observe faster download speeds with your local curl binary, this provides a switch to easily enable Vagrant to use the local binary.  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. It is something I have investigated multiple times, but the number of variables involved makes this extremely difficult to get a valid reproduction. I have updated Vagrant's functionality to make the underlying cause more easily understandable where available (redirect notifications) or easier to work around. I am continuing to investigate our options for box downloads from Vagrant Cloud in different regions of the world (which have occasionally presented with issues). However, with box downloads from third party locations, there is little I am able to do to control their available bandwidth or any kind of throttling they may impose.  Cheers!"
not_technical,"Wow! Downloading boxes is painful please fix this. PLEASE? I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. I haven't had slow speeds in a while. It seems very hit or miss. In fact, if it is slow you and start and stop it with the chance of getting a better connection. I'm not sure this is really the fault of the vagrant framework as much as it is the nature of large bottlenecked downloads."
not_technical,"Well, nothing has changed, it still downloads at a snail's pace given that i am on a 125 Mbps connection! Sooooooooooooooo slowly:("
not_technical,This box is actually a box I built using packer and it is hosted on a remote server. I'm trying to understand why the download in significantly slower using vagrant then using wget to the exact same URL. sorry - I misread your original issue.  I would suspect (and maybe mitchellh could elaborate more) a few things: 1. Ruby is slow and somehow throttling the subprocess 2. Wget is faster than curl (which is what Vagrant is using) 3. Vagrant is also allocating time to unpack the box 4. Wget is allowing for some type of compressed download  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference.
not_technical,"So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem.  Why would anyone even consider using .BAT files to automate Java code compilation or execution?  I'm such an idiot.  I'm so sorry for wasting your precious time with a totally realistic scenario, and providing examples to support it. Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience.  The Wikipedia snippet, a somewhat pathetic and non-authoritative source, in all honesty, actually supports my argument. If I ever make a contribution to Google I will be sure to include that BOM. It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me. Hi, first, let me say thank you for sending this PR, I should have done so in an earlier comment. Rejecting the PR is in no way a statement about you, nor your qualifications. Although it's true that Google's public style guides are under-curated (a situation we all lament, but no one has stepped up to address) we care very deeply about the contents of our style guides, and therefore are very conservative in what we add to it. My intent here was to bring closure to this issue, since it had unfortunately sat unaddressed for some time. You are absolutely right that there are situations where a BOM can matter, and it is reasonable to discourage their use. In our experience at Google this has not been a major issue (admittedly, most internal development happens on Linux, so issues related to .bat scripting are indeed something we don't typically run into). Looking into historical internal discussions around BOMs affecting Google Java developers I can find very little, and nothing related to BOMs in the .java source files themselves. None of which invalidates your concern, but in our opinion it doesn't rise to a level of severity to merit calling out in the Style Guide. Many best practices are intentionally not included in the guide simply because we don't want to make a ruling we don't have to. We trust teams to identify their own best practices where we don't make stipulations. Of note, this doesn't appear to be a Java-specific issue, and I notice only the HTML/CSS guide makes any mention of it. Perhaps we should consistently discourage BOMs across all our style guides, but I don't believe it's necessary to make the Java guide an outlier in this regard. I would ask that you do so with good-faith, but *please do* include a BOM if you believe it is relevant. We put a lot of faith in our tooling, and count on developers both internally and externally to help catch places where our tooling falls short. If a BOM breaks something we rely on, we will want to fix it. You might even get paid if you are able to find an exploit related to mishandling of BOMs.. One of the things I have deeply, deeply valued about my time at Google has been the candid and open discussions around issues of identity, gender inequality, and respect. We continue to fall short in many ways, but I am proud of the effort my peers have made to create a culture that is welcoming and inclusive. I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt. Again, thank you for raising this issue."
not_technical,"It's not the goal of the Java Style Guide to address all possible configuration issues, we require Java source code to be UTF-8 for numerous reasons, but the presence or absence of a BOM is not something we need to make a ruling on. Leave it off when possible, as the UTF-8 spec already says. So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem.  Why would anyone even consider using .BAT files to automate Java code compilation or execution?  I'm such an idiot.

not_technical,Thanks for the kind words.  Please let me know if you still have any issues with your data or learning process. I am very new in scikit-learn.  My questions is: how to download my own dataset (csv file).  I will be highly appreciated any answers.
not_technical,We could tell you what the problem is but I think in this case you will learn more from it if you find it on your own. You should read the error message carefully. It is a Python syntax error. I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself.
not_technical,"To be clear, these previous posters are saying that being somewhat comfortable with the Python language is a prerequisite to using scikit-learn. You have missed some quotes around a string. This shows great unfamiliarity with Python (and a characteristic of most programming languages), and scikit-learn is probably not the best place to start. Just want to support --- I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is."

Cheers! we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved.  However, you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. Therefore, I would like to make some points clear for you. As you can see from, scikit-learn is a community effort that is developed by a team of volunteers, mostly on their free time. Gal is one of the creators of the project and its current leader: scikit-learn would certainly not be the same without his contribution (the same for other volunteers), and he certainly did not deserve your dismissive words.  What I would like to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a scikit-learn ""product"", or scikit-learn ""staff"" (only a handful of people have worked full time on the project). You mention ""we as users are customers"", but how much are you paying for using scikit-learn? Despite the important development cost, users get scikit-learn for free (and of course that's how it's intended to be). In fact, the development of the project relies on a fragile alchemy: users' needs being a top priority for developers, and users reporting bugs and concerns in the most positive way. The kind of ""ranting"" that you wrote can be very discouraging for developers, who contribute their free time and their expertise just because they believe that scikit-learn is a useful tool for the community. Some prominent developers stopped contributing to open-source software precisely because of such ""customer-like attitude"" of a few people underlining only shortcomings, and dismissing the huge development efforts. Please try to see the bright side as well: you received advice and comments from a lot of people, I'm sure that there was something for you to learn out of it, even if it did not solve your problem.  Also, although users' needs are indeed a top priority of scikit-learn (it has an amazing documentation, of which most scientific Python packages can be jealous!), each software addresses a well-targeted niche of users, and it is just normal that scikit-learn cannot fit all users. For example, it is preferable to use scikit-learn with already a good knowledge of Scientific Python. So, I'm really glad that you found a package that suited your needs better, but please also acknowledge the time and good will that people gave away when answering you.  So, folks, let's all show some good will and keep a constructive dialog. That's how the project we love will keep on rocking!"

I let Gatling community know that Gatling exhibits strange behavior in the presence of other libraries, and you slandelle do not care.  It is OK too, it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. If I state that your sample ""works for me"", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning.

I let Gatling community know that Gatling exhibits strange behavior in the presence of other libraries, and you slandelle do not care.

It looks like you're missing/didn't install the windows universal module for unity. For the second issue, Visual Studio 2017 is required for the latest versions of this project. Keep in mind this known issue w/Visual Studio 2017.3 and all current Releases of Unity. I also happened with such problemit confused me for two days. I had reinstalled VS2017 with 15.3 for many times,but it didn't work. I also tried to update the Unity , but the old project can't be opened without any questions. I had a very long way to find the solution(I also tried VS2015) . At last the VS2017 with 15.0 and the unity 5.6.2 works well in my computer, that is my way to solved this problem.

I'm just sick of having to go through thousands of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on.

not_technical,"please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work.  Please feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? Or did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate so I'll just say this:  - The devs have been very responsive, and have been  accommodating of the many (often mutually conflicting) requests coming in from users. By this token the ""old Microsoft"" assertion seems unfounded and potentially disheartening for the people who have plowed a lot of work in to this. - This is a beta product, if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. - Some decisions will be made that won't work in your favour. Many won't work in my favour. However these are educated decisions made in the interest of supporting the average user (not just you), by talented devs who are acknowledging some compromise but are making pragmatic decisions nonetheless. By assuming your needs are paramount, you are potentially dismissing the needs of other users (e.g. WSL users like me who support the sensible decision to align with Gnome bindings and avoid escape sequence characters for default bindings). - This is open source. If you feel you have the expertise to override their decisions, then you are free to implement changes in your own fork. If you don't have that expertise, you can't reasonably claim that the decision taken is actually wrong. ""It's not what I'm familiar with"" is probably not a good enough justification (in my view).  I won't reply to responses as I know it won't add anything and that I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry!"
not_technical,"Nope, it wasn't.  Making Ctrl+Shift+C the keybinding for copy is pointless. You may as well make it anything else Ctrl+P. People expect Ctrl+C and using anything except that will just make the copy feature undiscoverable. I couldn't agree more with CobusKruger. Some things are just so common and expected, that not to use them just seems like you're actively hiding features from users. No one expects CTRL+SHIFT+C/V, They expect CTRL+C/V, If it were otherwise, there wouldn't be so many users here clamoring for it. CTRL+C/V is what should be in the json by default.

not_technical,"This was fixed with #1093 I don't think this is fixed?  The changes in #1093:  - set the default binding to ctrl+shift+c - and even if we could rebind the default to ctrl+c, doesn't implement the copy-if-text-selected-or-send-ctrl+c semantics discussed in I apologise if I've misread any of the code.  I've been fighting years of muscle memory this last week because ctrl+c doesn't work, I realise it may seem like a triviality, but I think it's important for user experience."

not_technical,"Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent.  We've drawn a clear line between what goes in Gatling OSS and what goes in Gatling FrontLine: all new things related to stats/exports/integrations go into Gatling FrontLine.  We're more than happy with contributions related to core Gatling features such as HTTP and users orchestration. But we can't make any exception to the above rule. I am sorry but I don't really understand your reasoning, although I understand your concern around protecting the Enterprise value.  Just to confirm, your strategy is to prefer for us to fork this project so that we can use a logger for a single line of code where you are currently using println, pushing us further away from wanting the Enterprise solution because you are classifying using a logger to output the summary as part of stats/exports/integrations, although that information is already being outputted in a different form?  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project.  I believe gatling is great as a project, I believe you should get paid to support and continue working on it full time, I also believe large companies should pay and help support opensource initiatives.   The problem is that I also believe your approach will alienate many people, or at least me and all the people I talk to about this.  It's a very simple code change, that actually makes it more consistent, as the majority of of your code base uses loggers (as any developer would expect).  You are not even arguing about not outputting that data because it's stats/enterprise data.  The data is there and available in the logs already!  The only difference is the primitive output mechanism.  The fact that many modern log shipping frameworks expect json/structured logs means that using println automatically makes you a less attractive product for both enterprise and non enterprise adopters.  These println statements just create noise in most modern log shipping frameworks I have worked with as they cannot be interpreted as a single event.  This is genuine feedback.  I would urge you to reconsider the quick decision, because I believe this suggestion exposes no more information than you currently do, moves you towards a more standardized output like the rest of your code base, and would actually show you positively engaging in improving your entire product offering, OSS and Enterprise.  The functionality you are planning as part of Enterprise are still attractive to companies like ours, e.g. aggregation of metrics etc, grafana datasources etc.  I think you've convinced yourself that any improvements to OSS is a risk to Enterprise.  Just doesn't sit well with me."
not_technical,"Ok, I'll concede on this. Though I think it's unrealistic to expect someone/a company to pay money for a tool that works perfectly fine for them, just to have finer grain control over their logs. We're not asking for real time live graphs or monitoring of injectors. This is something we are more then happy to do the work for to improve the tool, so it's shame we can't contribute in that way. Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent.

not_technical,"I think that a disclaimer would also be really helpful for those languages that will keep the translate block - it could act as a teaching opportunity. Something like this:   Translating to another language is difficult, and computers haven't quite mastered it yet. Only use this extension when trying to understand a project that was created in another language - you can remix it and add the translate block to your remix. We recommend that you do not publish such remixes. Do not use the translate block inside of  join  blocks, because it will result in the wrong word order for some languages and you'll sound like Yoda. Please be aware that machine translation can produce offensive content by accident and that it will often contain grammar errors.  A similar disclaimer could be added to published projects that contain translate blocks, to prevent misunderstandings.  You should also be aware that grammar errors in machine translation results can be detrimental to foreign language learning, because the grammar errors will imprint themselves on students' visual memories and these memory imprints are very hard to get rid of. For example, although I have been called ""as fluent as a Bard"" by native speakers, I still have difficulty with vowel length after over a decade of learning Gaelic, because I have seen too many texts where the accents on the vowels were missing.  Here's a real-life example of machine translation grammar errors from the English - German language pair. I have left the airport a note and they have now corrected it. I appreciate the sentiment, but you're getting a little extreme. Let's look over your proposed disclaimer: Translating to another language is difficult, and computers haven't quite mastered it yet. Only use this extension when trying to understand a project that was created in another language  Right off the bat, this is already very extreme. Why shouldn't you use the translate extension for a purpose other than this? Computers haven't quite mastered it, sure - but they're already very good, and 99% of the time translation errors are caused by GIGO rather than actual mistranslation. you can remix it and add the translate block to your remix. We recommend that you do not publish such remixes.  Why not?? What's wrong with sharing your attempt at understanding another language? Do not use the translate block inside of join blocks, because it will result in the wrong word order for some languages and you'll sound like Yoda.  Good recommendation, but the ""you'll sound like Yoda"" is too informal for a disclaimer. And in many languages word order isn't as significant (e.g. Latin) and grammar is mostly determined by word endings, rather than order. Nothing wrong with using join blocks with languages like that. I think this should read something more like ""Pay attention to what language you're translating when putting the translate block inside join blocks. Sentences in some languages may have completely different meanings based on word order.""  Please be aware that machine translation can produce offensive content by accident and that it will often contain grammar errors.  Can produce offensive content by accident: yes. Often contain grammar errors: no. At least for Google Translate (which is, I believe, the API that the translate blocks run on), the grammar errors are few and far between. Most issues with machine translation are with prosidy and not syntax. Better to say that ""machine translation can contain grammar errors or offensive content by accident"".  As for your real-life examples: Scratch isn't going to be used in airport displays (if they are, I'd be quite shocked) and the ""an""/""am"" problem looks to be a transcription error rather than an error of the machine itself (like somebody said to the person typing, ""am Flugsteig"" but the ""m"" sounded like an ""n"").  Don't get me wrong - I do agree that some languages should not be in here as there is too little to base machine translations on, and Scottish Gaelic fits that description - I just think your disclaimer is a little too strong, a little too scary, and a little inaccurate."

not_technical,"OK, so I'm assuming from the list of applications you are using that you are using a Linux distribution of some sort. The PPD comes from the HPLIP project.  Unfortunately, this isn't something we can help you with - either the cups-filters raster filter is not honoring the DefaultOutputOrder value in the PPD or the HPLIP driver isn't doing something right. Either way you need to start with your Linux distribution's bug reporter and go from there... I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? What about the other questions I asked? You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? Can you point me to the place in the documentation where you say which of lpadmin/lpoptions/PPD solutions is expected to make the printer work correctly with all CUPS clients? Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software?  Can you give the HP people a hint on how the HP filter would need to be modified so that it respects the lpadmin setting not just with Evince print jobs but also with jobs submitted by Okular and lp? Or how can Okular be modified so that it prints correctly on inkjets?  Is there another brand of inkjet printers, which works correctly with CUPS?  What about cups-pdf, I've noticed that when printing to the virtual PDF printer then lp doesn't respect the lpadmin setting, Evince doesn't respect the lpoptions setting, and Okular doesn't respect either. Is that still an HP problem? Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project?"
not_technical,"The non-CUPS software is not following the standard interfaces that CUPS provides. IOW, this is either a bug in HPLIP or cups-filters. If they follow the standard interfaces you won't have to do a damned thing to have things Just Work„. We can't fix software that isn't ours...  As for pstops, no not all jobs get routed through there. Maybe 18 years ago that was the case, but not today.  As for the documentation, it is correct if the underlying driver or filters follow the standard interfaces. So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly?  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers:  ""Can you point me to the place in the documentation where you say which of lpadmin/lpoptions/PPD solutions is expected to make the printer work correctly with all CUPS clients?"""

So, I'm still interested to hear others' experiences with the AMD ROCm/HIP stack, if they're working on a Tensorflow fork it'd be great, provided it actually works on more than 3/4 models of AMD card in the wild.

not_technical,"What about ARM or Broadcom ? The former probably has subpar OpenCL implementation and the latter doesn't even officially provide OpenCL drivers! It's not Google's responsibility to create and maintain a competent compute stack for hardware vendors ...  You realize that training neural nets with embedding layers on PlaidML is painful, right ? PlaidML also has a bunch of other limitations as well such as not being all that well suited for DenseNets or the fact that it's computation graphs are static and does PlaidML even work well with RNNs ?  As for your project, don't worry about it. You'll move on to something better like Tensorflow since AMD will soon offer a native GPU backend for it once MIOpen gets upstreamed which is their GPU accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks similar to their competitor's cuDNN library both of which will leave PlaidML in the dust in terms of performance. Who cares about Intel iGPUs anyway ? If Intel is truly committed to delivering high performance deep learning on their future discrete graphics hardware then they'll offer a single source option just like the others (AMD/HIP and Nvidia/CUDA) did before them ...   PyTorch has no future. Envy much ? PyTorch is 10x more popular than PlaidML, newest techniques in DL are implemented easily on PyTorch, tons of different contributors and is actively developed by Facebook all the while Intel hasn't contributed to PlaidML in nearly a month ?   What to maintain in plaidML ? Ops are auto differentiable, there is nothing to maintain. So I take it from you that PlaidML shouldn't receive any new fixes or new features in the future going forward ? If you don't see the value in improving code then there's no point in convincing you to acknowledge PlaidML's glaring flaws ...   Machine learning is invented by professors of mathematics, isn't it? Doesn't mean we have to take up whatever programming language they make up especially in the case of Tile where elegance is clearly favoured over readability.

In this context, I am not sure what the opencl version of cuDNN is. Also AMD has been talking about open-source alternatives to CUDA which they are continuously developing and are calling rocM. They are also talking about miOpen to be the cuDNN equivalent (handcrafted assembler libraries for common deep learning functions), which however has not been released yet. The AMD approach is somewhat more holistic: We are not just exporting heavy-compute to the GPU. In this context, I am genuinely confused. How do opencl efforts like the ones listed above fit together? For NVIDIA GPUs, it's easy....there is CUDA, and there is cuDNN written in CUDA. For non-NVIDIA/or in this case AMD, it seems so much less clear. When is HIP preferred? When is using the HCC preferred? When is using opencl preferred? Any insights would truly be appreciated! there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( Even if we can dream of a clean-slate solution based on pure scientific criteria, I think we have to be pragmatic. Google does not want to change too much of the TensorFlow architecture. This is why the OpenCL-based architecture has to be very similar, requiring single-source C++ like ""CUDA runtime"" instead  of the lower-level non-single-source OpenCL C solution. In the Khronos realm, the single-source C++ version of OpenCL is called SYCL. Let's discuss this when you drop by Dublin, for example, since you look to be based in Ireland too. :-) In the meantime, feel free to contribute to the TensorFlow & Eigen branches dealing with SYCL..."

not_technical,"WinUI is Windows 10 onwards.  I think it will support the Creators Update (**15063**) onwards.  But it is possible that as a new version of Windows 10 comes out, the lowest supported version may be dropped.  So that would be roughly 3 years of previous versions supported with each release.  As for the details of precise Win32 support - we will learn more during Ignite this coming week.  Windows 7 goes out of support at the end of the year, so if you use Windows 7, you will need to upgrade. I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish.  What ""exciting and unique"" you have in Win10 that your GUI lib(!!!) cannot work on Win7? Obviously if your lib so ""independed"" from platform, there is no any problem to support it on Win7. Moreover: Win10 is FAR from be the dominating OS, at least 50% users have Win7.

The ivy renderer in particular targets some of the pain points you mentioned.  We have two projects running in parallel, one angularjs and one angular5. And nobody here likes to touch the angularjs codebase. angular5 and the ecosystem around it is just wonderful (full template typecheck and linting, clean component interface, typescript by default, the template syntax and one way data flow). So we admire the work the team is doing with the framework. Also that there is always an upgrade path (and not a hard cut like angularjs=angular2).  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4? ˜)"

not_technical,"It is annoying that Norton flags the metrics uploader, but at this time there is no solution that works for the team at this time.  The uploader cannot be qualified by the major anti-virus vendors because it is built on the end users machine and is not signed.  We have discussed fiddling with the implementation of the uploader, but have decided against it because we don't want to obfuscate the code.  Also tricks that may work now could end up backfiring later.  Making the metrics uploader opt-in rather than opt-out does not solve the anti-virus issue either, it only makes it less noticeable.  In response to your concerns of the collection of usage metrics, I refer you to the privacy policy I just installed the current vcpkg and encountered this as well. I've read through #6551 and #3345. I see these closed but don't see any resolution.  What I do see is that Norton is very, very unhappy on my system with this tool. I've gotten SONAR reports about the metrics upload (and I'll also put in a vote for making metrics opt-in. I'm surprised that it is opt-out, and not terribly well documented opt-out). Norton is now saying that it needs to restart to finish cleaning out the security risks.  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. Minimally fix this to be opt-in. Beyond that, work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors."
not_technical,"My workaround was to tell Norton to reverse the quarantine decision and to not scan the metrics upload image.  Maybe I'm the only person bothered by the opaque decision to have this process upload data from my machine to some remote site.  But I am bothered by it.  I can surely support a "".\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -enableMetrics"" approach.  Or an approach that directly asks at the start of the bootstrap process if I want to upload metrics and either directly disclose, or be able to disclose, what will be uploaded. I'd focus less on Norton, per se, based on these prior reports.  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue.  Because: Your software (Norton) has established a false positive in it's threat detection.  And one single other bug report: Specifically, #3345 is clear that it is much more widespread.  Does not validate your position. Your logic fails to accommodate the fact that AV software (especially badly maintained, poorly coded AV software) is highly prone to false positive detection rates. The simple solution since the false positive problem was identified (decades ago) has been to report the false positive to the manufacturer using (commonly) their automatic reporting tool. I have already suggested that you do this and yet you persist to assert that your problem is one of Microsoft's making. I was, and am, surprised that Microsoft is recommending a solution that performs telemetry by default.  I'm sorry but if you were unaware, telemetry by default is how Windows 10 is shipping too. It is the default position of Microsoft products to do so. If you do not like this behaviour (and I personally find it repugnant) then turn it off. The method to do so, as already mentioned is -disableMetrics. Now, can I fork the code to do whatever I want? Sure. Can I propose a fix? Sure.  Both rhetorical questions. Does that change the surprise at the telemetry by default and the lack of visibility, or that this has been reported for over a year?  And yet according to your report: This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have.  Please don't attempt to change the topic of this thread. We get it. You don't like metrics. False positive detections by AV products have nothing to do with Microsoft's level of security awareness. You can report false positives to AV product manufacturers. And you can also turn off vcpkg's metrics using a single switch. This in turn should prevent the false positive triggering.  Let us know how you get on. Thanks."
not_technical," This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft  I don't work for MS. Your tone is derogatory.  Your software (Norton) has established a false positive in it's threat detection. Please work with the software manufacturer to establish a resolution on their part.  There is nothing Microsoft or anyone else can do if a piece of third party software on your machine malfunctions. One solution is to use Windows built-in threat detection tools instead of the unreliable Norton software. I am actually quite shocked that Norton are even still in business. Their AV and other ""Security"" products have been malfunctioning and underperforming for well over 20 years.  Because vcpkg is open source, you can modify the source code any way that you wish once you have obtained a copy locally, so I'm unsure what else to say other than it would appear that the software Norton have sold you is not providing you value for money and is also causing you frustration instead as well."

No one wants to breaks compatibility, but it is inevitable even when semver is applied. It's in fact not about contracts, It is about evolution which cannot be predicted precisely. Another wrong believe is that updated should always be executed after software updates. Nodejs has a service called green keeper which strengthens that wrong believe. Software quality is nothing to do with updates, newer updates maybe worse and mass things up.  so updates should be applied when they are tested extensively not because they are newer. programmers should be selective to one stable version.

not_technical,"versions should focus mainly on their functionalities and should try to keep compatibilities.  major versions for architectural changes. minor versions for feature changes within the same architecture. patch versions for bug fixes (regardless of their compatibilities)  the reality is that npm's introduced dependency hell due to semver and npm's version range.  maybe semver is more innocent than npm's version range.  But they are both wrong, they are now chained to amplify the incorrectness.  And they constantly claim that package maintainers violate their rules.  It is one of the most funny things ever happened in software development :) Some respected libraries use semver, they always obey the semver rules and it is very useful for consumers.

Semver bears a good will, but it will never be a realistic one. A false good will always lead to a bad result. Npm's auto update has shown the downside and now lock fill has be introduced for remedy.  I don't know why you still insist on use semver, what benefits do you gain on applying semver?  Get sky high version number? Make versions meaningless? Upgrade major version on every small change that breaks? Auto updates that makes software unstable?  I think there must be a list of gains if semver should be adopted.   I apologize for using stupid if it is offensive.  Software quality will not be improve by merely defining very strict rules."

I'll also add that Node API is somewhat contrary to our years-long efforts to have the name of the runtime spelled Node.js and not Node (or NodeJS or a number of other variatns).  Of course, now that the name change has already happened, there are significant costs/downsides to changing the name a second time in such a short period of time. I'd still support it, though, if the name was more descriptive and not subject to misinterpretation. A better name is better for our users. I'm -1 on changing the name again and I appreciate the effort the node-api team put into making the changes. It's a good change."

Your original commit in the PR looked fine and will work, but the review I submitted is how ansible code base does it. I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. I understand your request but I'm not sure it is the most efficient. Release fast and refactor after by actors that have an interest (they'll make time) in it (dissecting to list() brings not value to my use case). Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to ""discuss"" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself. It's clearly less effective than merge and refactor later added to the fact I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. There is much more to gain by going fast on smalls steps/iteration and securing what you have asap, that's my way of working anyway so very subjective I'll give you that.

not_technical,"I think ashwinraghav explained this pretty well! We support a JSON REST API since that's a common standard for REST APIs on the web, and XML defaults on Android since that's the standard for the platform. I understand there can be frustration working between the formats.  You should only need to define RC in-app defaults once though - in the XML file. The default values saved online and available through the REST API are the server-side defaults used when no condition is met. There's more documentation on how Remote Config prioritizes parameter values in the docs here I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt ""frustrating"" this is a super stupid architecture design... I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not.  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: ""Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy.  We will provide a rest service which accepts data in the json format. And in case developer wants to set some default values he can use a XML/plist""  In my company someone proposing such a frankstein architecture would be fired.  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart?  this is a wrong assumption, although i agree these values shouldn't change very often, software are LIVE things: they grow, they mutate, they acquire new powers. Same way new constants are added, removed, or default values might change in a lifetime of any software. If you were using RC on the innitial development of other firebase services, are you telling me that the default values of 3 years ago would still work for today?   I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that.

not_technical,"I lock this issue everything is here.  If someone want to improve our docs feel free to do it, or you can open an issue which point what is missing in our docs I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. In hope to save others the time, I thought i'll share the final recipe. (notice bootstrap has two dependencies - jquery and tether. If you would rather have explicit versions of those two, you should install them as well) (i'm assuming you're using es6, in case of es5, use require('bootstrap'))  The previous line will only import the js part of bootstrap. for the styling part you have two options -  ### 1. Precompiled SASS Inside one of your sass files (index.scss for example) add this line - SASS (notice the ~ (tilde) which points to the node modules folder) This mehtod is beneficial if you plan on using your own version of the wonderful   variables  file bootstrap comes with. just make sure you import   variables  before  bootstrap . Also, now you can use all the cool mixins bootstrap has.  ### 2. Compiled CSS only If you're not planning on using the variables or the mixins, and prefer the precooked css file, simply add this line to index.js or any other js file - (btw - you can also import this way the sass file, but it's nicer to import it via another sass file as shown in pervious mehtod)  now comes the webpack part. for  jquery  and  tether  to be available as a global variable throughout the project, you'll have to add this to your webpack plugins sections.  The different jquery definition are meant to answer requirements of different libraries (for example angular looks for 'window.jQuery'). I'm assuming your webpack.config already has rules for scss and/or css.  And that's it! now you have bootstrap in your webpack project. Let me know if any further explanation is needed, and if anyone knows of a better way, please share."
not_technical,"good question. I took this convention from sass-loader, but if in addition to sass-loader you're also using postcss than this could be related. Anyway you can try without the tilde, or worst case use '../../node modules'.  let me know how it goes. Really nice explanations. I'm also using Bootstrap w/ Webpack but I have a slightly different configuration regarding the ""Jquery & Tether"" part. Instead of using this. which does not inject  as a global variable but 'auto-require' it when encountered in a dependency, I use the ""expose-loader"" (which, actually, expose global variables ,-) ). You could use it directly in the webpack config but, personnaly, I prefer using it in my entry file like this. (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) But if you prefer the webpack config way, it looks like this. My 2 cents..."
not_technical,"Well done! It worked nicely for me. Thanks! So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... The webpack documentation page looks so simple but it is not that simple, apparently. Please include some more documentation on how to test if it is working and if there are any differences when using typescript. I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's..."
not_technical,"Smells to me like could be related to this issue, try a couple of things for me -  1. use a secondary scss, and add this code **before** importing bootstrap - 2. upgrade style-loader to 0.17.0 3. take a look at a demo project implementing bootstrap Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order,"
not_technical,"Well, I'm not a Webpack guru myself, and I'm glad you sorted it out, but just gonna mention that my setup is importing the individual bootstrap.js pieces (so that you can select only the necessary ones), and you are importing the whole package.

Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time."
not_technical,"Hey folks - I'm locking this. tom-adsfund I agree with raver119 - the proper solution would be for us to add support for fast text, not ""deprecate"" word2vec.

Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository.  Now, as for the question of FastText - that's an internal roadmap question and question of priorities.

Please, add a step on the Step by Step Tutorial to demonstrate how to theme the just finished demo app.  ## Motivation  1. Theming is not an obvious task for a newbie like me. Also, doc speaks about gem based and 'regular' file themes. It's confusin  a bit. 2. At the end of demo app it's more beautiful to leave in the han of the user a well looking demo  ## Idea  Please include istructions on - how to enable default gem base theme - how to customized if possible a gem theme - how to switch to a regular file based theme - idem, how to customize it  ... or ...  Create a guide on how to start theming AND then include previous steps into the new tutorial.  Thanks for this excellent piece of software !!!!"

Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not.  The only issue we extracted from this seems to be the same as #103. If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive.  Now to the issue at hand.  When I try to uninstall unused dotnet core SDKs and Runtimes from my server through Add/Remove Programs, I get an error ""Windows cannot find  Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."" I've been trying to rebuild the cache using various tools, but they only work with using **InstallerFiles** directory. Why did you guys move the cheese? What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy?  I guess it's another poor decision built upon a legacy of other equally poor decisions, i.e. a vortex or blackhole of bad decision.  I tried to use your core-uninstall-tool but it was a complete failure.  Running the command with no arguments gave me an error ""Required command was not provided"".  Running it with the list command gave me another error ""The specified version is not valid: """".""  WTF?  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done.  Anyway, I figured I would try a hack. I downloaded the runtime again performed a repair.  It appeared to succeed, but when I tried to uninstall it from program and files, it complained that it couldn't find the package cache.  I reran the installer and selected uninstall and it mysteriously worked. Have you ever considered requiring hacks like these to get your horrible products to work only encourages hacking?  This is similar to your onerous, poorly conceived user authentication system in Windows, requiring IT personnel and end-users to just turn it off so they can get work done?  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!!  Apple rose from the brink of bankruptcy and leapfrogged you guys because they cared about quality, simplicity and taste. It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development.  Where's the shame?"

not_technical,"I agree, several more challenges need to be added to the ES6 section to fill in said knowledge gaps.

If you have any suggestions for possible challenges you'd like to see before this one, please leave a comment. Or even better, please help us make a new challenge!

not_technical,"Is this still an issue? If so, then if I understand the problem correctly, the solution will be creating a text base explanation of how arrow functions work over ES5, emphasizing the chaining of arrow functions, right? I am pretty green PR-wise so not sure if I should just start, I don't want to do it wrong, etc. If the above is correct I'll do this. My suggestion would be to greatly simplify the problem such that it can be solved by changing a normal function definition into an arrow function definition.  It's not even important that the output of the function be checked, just the syntax.  Just make sure that the instructions line up and that the tests check for the correct syntax.  I think that would be the most direct solution.  I'd say go for it!  Making these types of changes was how I got started.  It's great experience!"
not_technical,"in general the whole es6 section seems to too advanced and/or complexly written (or at least some of it), and the javascript section as a whole seems a little scattered and not simple enough for beginners, or maybe just doesn't progress gradually enough or something - I want to suggest some rearranging of some sections/challenges but Im not sure on a better way yet - there's more than a few forum posts from campers struggling in this area of the curriculum Thanks for this post! I was super confused trying to solve this as well and I've even been exposed to .map() and higher order functions previously. I thought for sure there would be a way to solve it with only .filter() because they haven't even said what the other functions do when you get to this exercise, or that it's possible to chain them together. I managed to solve it with a really ugly workaround, still using .map() but forgot about .parseInt() and that you can chain the functions... Cheers!"

This is all voodoo to me, but one request: make sure that even if using vh/vw etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like px/rem/em. Otherwise (when a font size is purely related to viewport dimensions and nothing else) you kill the user's ability to (full page) zoom on desktop and change the size the text is rendered at (as yes, the viewport dimensions change, but the font size would then change proportionally in the opposite direction, meaning the apparent font size is never actually altered)."
not_technical,"Time for some updates. - As suggested by ysds, I've increased the rfs-base-font-size to 1.25rem. The result: - Large inputs don't rescale by default - It generates less css - The displays rescale enough on smaller viewports, because I've also increased the rfs-factor - Because of the changes to the form controls, the input-height-inner-sm and input-height-inner-sm became unneeded. I eventually dropped them because these are variables that are generated by other variables and not used anywhere else in the code, they were only used to calculate input-height-sm & input-height-lg.  I did some changes upstream and made a branch for the next major version of RFS which is in sync with this PR. This branch has some automated testing, so that we'll not break anything if we're going to update things in the future. This is really slick.

not_technical,"(Sorry, I won't be one of them.)  OK, maybe I will comment a little bit. Some of these so-called ""core problems of node.js"" are just unimportant things we'll have to keep supporting or else break the entire ecosystem. So no, they won't get ""fixed"". But they're also not ""broken"". For example, supporting ""index.js"" as the default file for modules is maybe a less-than-perfect original decision, but now that there are hundreds of thousands of modules that do this, we're not going to change. The benefit of changing is negligible and the cost of changing is enormous. Maybe to add one thing: If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, I'm sure we can arrange that. :slightly smiling face:"

not_technical,"### SOLUTION IS LISTED FOR WIKIPEDIA CORS ERROR A api request to wikipedia from flutter web and the error was very simple the ""**CORS error**"". as it happens i did what we all do ""Search The Google"" and to many result specially associate with flutter, but most important is so many issues are still not closed. This person tries to understand what these errors are and why it happen. f**irebase, google storage CORS error** better check this out on stackoverflow. **wikipedia api CORS error** check this out. **at my side** what i was missing was  a &origin=* url parametere with value. previous url  with error. new updated working url here. Now that Flutter Web has gone mainstream, this seems to resurface again. So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.**  If you use a web service, you have to abide by CORS rules. Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. **Flutter has nothing to do with it.** While you might be able to disable CORS as described above for yourself in **debug**, there's absolutely no way to do it in **release** for your users. Simply impossible and would be so dangerous no browser vendor would ever allow it.  (For a simple description: CORS means that the web service you try to use has the ability to decide whether it accepts and handles incoming requests from your web app. Obviously, if it refuses to serve you, your Flutter app cannot force it to do so because the browser it runs in will enforce these rules, no matter what you do. So, you have to look around and see how the **web service** you want to use proposes to handle the situation. If it's an established web service, there will be a solution because CORS applies to every one of their API users, not just Flutter ones.)"

My situation was practically identical to what diablodale describes.  **SOLUTION**  Even though you have your keys setup and you can do example commands like docker -H ssh:userip ps, you can still run into auth issues because this extension is specifically making using of the ""ssh-agent"" under the hood.   **IMPORTANT**: Don't get these steps confused with similar things that can be done in WSL. Things done in WSL do not affect the outcome. This extension does not use WSL under the hood even if you have your terminal configured to use WSL. You must have it setup through the means the Windows OS uses.  1. Follow directions here to enable the Windows SSH-Agent.  This addresses the errors with the pipe in the message. 2. Ensure that you have your SSH keys inside of <windows user folder/.ssh/. 3. Run ssh-add from powershell.

Why is this issue still assigned to the 2.5 milestone when ansible 2.5 is already release a long time ago ? See #44556 for outdated milestones.

not_technical,"Just adding a reference to my comments on #95898, which in the end is discussing both approaches. Since there is no need for uses to configure http2 health check, I do think we should add http2 health check by some reasonable default values, and if you guys think pingTimeout=2s is two short, we can tune it larger, maybe default 15s is a good option. Besides I can't find any significance that setting http2 Transport ReadIdleTimeout as the half of http Transport IdleConnTimeout, Is there any relationship between these two configurations? PR #95898 looks pretty but unnecessary, again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. And I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem.

not_technical,"If the only failure in UWP happens when using this library with MessagePack, and the failure is within MessagePack itself, we should close this issue since it isn't a bug in StreamJsonRpc. So now I'm going to reply exactly the way Microsoft replies to me. MichalStrehovsky correctly stated that ""since ~.NET Framework 1.0"", the .Net Native compiler has had certain documented behaviors in the way it generates its code.   The implication being that an understanding of .Net Native characteristics requires different design choices.  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger.  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works.  Or, the problem is the .Net Native compiler documentation because even Microsoft staff are not aware of the design considerations they have to employ to build products that support Microsoft tech. Or, the problem is the way Microsoft operates internally because you folks are prepared to ignore each other and go off to build tooling that your customers are unable to use.  Or, the problem is Microsoft knows what the future holds, and dumps technology support for its existing tech knowing that that tech is about to be invalidated by what comes next.  There are several other logical or cases.  You get the point.  This issue is not related to MessagePack.  I don't want it swept under the rug because either Microsoft is here to support the developers using its tech, or Microsoft does as it pleases regardless of how it affects the developers it has convinced to use its tech.  I suggest you run this by your bosses.  Either you made a mistake, or the entire organization has."
not_technical,"are you referring to this issue: where you interacted with me? That comment is specifically to the behavior of the Assembly.Location API that returns the documented value when there's no filesytem location for the loaded assembly. .NET Native compiles apps into a single file and the original assemblies are gone. It has no choice but to return the only possible documented value. It could also throw, but that won't help in grpc's case either.  I'm afraid you're sidetracking this discussion in a way that won't help you get a resolution in streamjsonrpc. I don't see Assembly.Location being called within this repo. Do you have an error message or a repro so that we can act on this? Thank you for chiming in.  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous.  You folks are well aware of the .Net Native problems and design considerations.  The developer of MessagePack and AArnott's contributions to that code base are not at fault here.  AArnott is a very smart fellow as are you MichalStrehovsky.  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way.  However, that's the real problem and characterizing it any other way is also a problem.  Sadly, I'm not expecting Microsoft to do anything other than replace the .Net Native compiler with whatever the new .Net Core AOT strategy will be.  Until that happens, you folks need to own up to where things are really headed.  It's obvious the reboot is well on the way.  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed.  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations.  This library is a nice piece of work.  I'd like to be able to use it."
not_technical,"Starting bottom up, MessagePack bombs on code like this: So fixing MessagePack should fix streamjsonrpc.  I wouldn't be too quick to blame gRPC, since Microsoft is using it and endorsing it as a replacement for WCF.  The current ""flaw"" in the gRPC code base is the way it makes use of Assembly.Location, which is used in a similar manner in many other libs.  Remove this bug and gRPC works in a UWP Release build as well as any other context. Thanks! This is failing with the following stack trace (if you check the checkbox next to ""Common Language Runtime Exceptions"" in the Visual Studio's Exception window: MessagePack relies on Reflection.Emit that is not supported by .NET Native.  There was a NuGet package created that makes it appear NetStandard supports reflection emit, but creating that NuGet package was a big mistake, because that API only works on two out of 4 implementation of NetStandard. This created a situation that some NetStandard libraries can't work on all NetStandard runtimes. People in charge tried to fix the issue by unpublishing the package (so that we don't have a broken ecosystem), but had to roll that back because of outcry from users. This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately."

StreamJsonRpc is only officially supported in contexts where it ships with Microsoft products that are under support agreements. In other words, we are not obligated to make it work for you in .NET Native and have never made a promise that we would do so.  Just because Microsoft makes two technologies does not guarantee that those technologies can work together. And just because I work at Microsoft doesn't mean I have any deeper understanding of the .NET Native toolchain than you do. Microsoft is a big place and one team rarely has unique insights into what another team/product is doing.  Further, you have yet to share any evidence that this is a StreamJsonRpc flaw at all. MessagePack clearly has issues on .NET Native, but StreamJsonRpc's support for MessagePack *as an option* hardly means that we're responsible to make MessagePack (a 3rd party OSS library) work under every possible Microsoft runtime. I expect you can use StreamJsonRpc on UWP just fine in its default configuration, although I haven't tested that nor are we promising support for that.  Now if MessagePack proclaims support for .NET Native, and StreamJsonRpc *still* doesn't work on that platform, then re-opening an issue on this repo with the specific error you're seeing is welcome and subject to our limited capacity to offer free OSS support we may take a look at the problem and suggest how you can make it work or possibly offer a fix.  It's not just design choices -- there are simply features that .NET Native doesn't support. Some of these reasons I understand and some I don't. But this library does not nor I imagine ever will limit its feature set to what's available on the least capable of Microsoft platforms. For example we support dynamically generated client proxies, which is a great feature that I don't know if it can be used with .NET Native (even without MessagePack). Given dozens of applications and millions of users benefit from this feature, we wouldn't remove it or have suppressed its development just because it can't ever work on a platform that no one even asked for support for before now.  So as I stated before, I'm closing this issue because there's no reason to believe a fix is required in this repo. We will keep the .NET Native issue on messagepack open because we expect code fixes are required in that repo. The .Net Native compiler is a bit of an engineering marvel.  I'd like to see it persist.  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts.  If there is something fundamentally false in anything I'm expressing, please do highlight my error(s).  If any of your work is not intended to support UWP, AArnott, then just add an exclusionary note, or say so in your opening remarks to such queries and I'll be happy to disappear.  I also don't want to waste my time.  I have merely pointed out that your design choices, not your competence, or your intellect, are at issue here.  And I had to go through a long winded process to make the point clear.  You can censor me if you like.  Just because you have the power to do so doesn't make that choice right either.  When you stated ""I'm surprised if it doesn't work."" You gave yourself away.  If I'm wrong in thinking that you knew it didn't work, then I apologize, because you closed the very issue that you had identified as the point of failure.  You see, I'm assuming you are quite bright AArnott based on the high quality of your work.  The quality of your personal choices, in that realm, we obviously have a difference of opinion."

not_technical,"No, generic tasks from the market place don't have pre-reqs.  The requirement is you install the task from the marketplace and it works.  Even if you entertained communicating pre-reqs, the problem is shifting pre-reqs.  If you pre-req 1.0 and everyone puts that in their container, when can your task start using capabilities of 1.1?  never.  If they heeded your pre-req at install time and their build works on the container they put your pre-req in, it will blow up when you change your task to code against 1.1 capabilities.  The fundamental problem is you have multiple layers from the agent, tasks and system that float on different lifetimes. That's why the agent and tasks are self contained.  You also have to be crisp between what's a dependency (node) and a tool (what the task is calling - msbuild, etc...).  Nothing is preventing you from creating a task in typescript that calls powershell / pester right now until and if we add this. That's a fair point about separating dependencies for the task from the tool, I always think of Java as a dependency for the SonarQube task but it's actually a dependency for the SonarQube tool that is presented to the user as requirement for the build agent to have installed.  The only clean way of handling making use of new functionality in newer versions of a dependency that I can see is to increment the major version number of your task, so it becomes a choice for the users to make use of it and the need to install a new version of the dependency. The other approach requires adding checks for that version in your code before trying to use it, which grants more compatability but takes more time and effort on the part of the task author.  I still think updating for new prereqs is less of a problem for people using containers due to their nature but I know there will be a large number who don't want to change their working container because a task updated a bit. It's also still a bigger problem for people not using containers as that takes more time and effort to roll out new versions of prereqs.  I'll certainly give some thought to writing a typescript wrapper for the pester task I already have and see how that performs. Hopefully some of these more interesting and difficult design questions can be worked out to enable a PS Core handler.  Thanks for taking the time to explain this stuff Bryan, it's given me a much better idea of how it all hangs together and the things you have to think about when working on the agents."
not_technical,"We're in the process of updating our dart:html APIs. That roll “ and getting rid of Dartium “ should make it easier to support the latest Browser features. Having said that, our primary framework “ AngularDart “ is not using WebComponent features, so it's not a big priority for us. My suggestion: once we've updated dart:html and friends, let us know specific APIs that are missing/broken That's really sad. In my mind a serious ""community centered"" effort should kind of use and depend on different independent blocks. to make the idea more clear, AngularDart for sure needs some stuff handling DOM and it seems sane to me to use something like dart:html as a basis. so, every work from google would be contributed back to the basis and others building on top of this basis would automatically benefit - somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) currently  Dart is more like: ""You want to do web?

not_technical,"Oh yeah, I guess I never really mentioned why I ever came to the original issue. I was relatively new in a position working as a Director at a medium sized corporation at the time, and the CTO above me insisted we use Go for new backend work instead of .NET, which the CTO and I both hated. I had enjoyed my dalliances with Go so the order was unopposed by me. I pushed it onto my subordinates, who pushed it onto theirs, and we started to dev backend in Go rather than .NET. A significant improvement, I thought. ""These fortunate devs under me who get to finally use a modern tech stack and not just go down the dead-end of .NET development,"" I thought, at the time. But then I got pushback after awhile about these kinds of issues, things like unnecessary verbosity, poor readability, unnecessary style control, etc, and was blown away. ""But those are just opinions."" Yeah, and the alternative is just an opinion. Saying Go is readable or necessarily verbose is absolutely not grounded in reality, and I took awhile to realize that. Eventually someone took me aside and pointed out that none of this is evidence based.  That's when I came here back in March, 2020. Eventually, we realized that it wasn't going to change on any reasonable timescale, and we eventually just started looking at different options -- but that's as far as we got while I was there.  The CTO left and then I got cancer and left.  Last I heard they were back on .NET. Fun story huh.  Oh, and we also pushed them to switch to Vue. They're still using Vue. This is a duplicate of the following issue.  I have temporarily forked Golang/Go and created this issue because the Golang overlords have stopped playing nice and they can no longer be trusted to host this conversation.  Regarding Go Issue, I propose again there is a third option: compromise.  On July 18, 2019, Github user stood up against the ""Go convention and language's designers arguments in the FAQ regarding the ternary conditional operator (""ternary operator""). The user stated specific examples where the ternary operator could improve readability. As of today, May 27, 2021 (the date the issue was locked as resolved and conversation limited), there were 105 thumbs up to this, and 107 thumbs against, with 5 frowny faces.  I personally suspect Google employees filled out the last of the 107 thumbs up and stopped after passing the 105 thumbs down, but that suspicion is admittedly groundless. (I'm sure I could investigate, it is accessible information, but I'm too lazy and just don't really care.)  Rather than hear reason or find compromise, the ""language's designers"" and their defenders (""the Golang overlords""/""the majority party"") planted themselves stubbornly against phrounz and the oncoming horde of software engineers forced into Golang projects by their corporate circumstances whose practical concern is just occasional convenience of the ternary operator in what is otherwise an ""I could take it or leave it"" programming language (""the minority party"").  Having seen 8 months of this debate upon my arrival to the issue on March 6, 2020, I offered a **compromise**, a **prediction**, and a **warning**. My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion.  The **compromise** I suggested was allowing the ternary operator to be enabled via configuration, even if it is off by default. That would have relieved the massive social tension that was building, and I believe it would have resolved the issue sufficiently for the minority party without totally sacrificing the values of the majority party, and thus manage to dispense the social energy without a social explosion. That is how a technology leader that understands people and how to resolve these kinds of issues masterfully handles these very delicate situations. The default of ""off"" is your win, which should be good enough for you. If you are truly right, it will remain off in the wild on average. If you are wrong, it will not remain off on average, because the world will decide you are wrong. I suspect, however, the world will just schism, and there will be about a fifty percent chance the option will be turned off no matter where you go (assuming the 105 thumbs up vs 107 thumbs down was legitimate and natural). These types of minor schisms happen all the time in software for precisely this reason, particularly in the realm of linting. You want that schism to occur out there in the wild, away from the language. Otherwise, the language will schism, and you will be forked, which was my **prediction**.  This brings me to the **warning**. I said, It is a mistake to think that a language should be the product of a small number of architects that know better without a deep connection to those that are actually using the language. I was surprised this was the only thing griesemer responded to, essentially saying he felt like I was wrong because the overlords talk amongst themselves and the majority party (my apologies if I'm mis-paraphrasing here). To which I would note that no, I mean really hearing all the signals coming in. By the time I arrived, the minority party was effectively muted. Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. We are that signal telling you something is wrong. Choosing to mute us rather than solve the underlying issue is like covering up screams with music, especially when the screams are not yours but you are the one causing the screams, and the one that can resolve the matter. In fact, you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. Most of the screams are so far away you've no hope of hearing them unless you really look. Try googling hate golang or golang ternary hate and really read the first forty or so results and really understand the loves and the frustrations and pain, and then realize that some of those people don't want to have to use your language but they are basically forced into it because of their jobs that switched to Golang from something else and they got a learn this or learn about your next employer ultimatum. (This wasn't me, btw. I learn new programming languages like other folks learn new songs. But I've read a lot of people's feedback about Golang while investigating this issue.)  So yes, you should want to know about all of these people's feedback, especially when it's them screaming in paper cut agony. Choosing not to hear it because you disagree with it is a bad choice. It lacks empathy. Not only is empathy moral, but it actually helps us constantly make the smart choice by keeping us on the same side as society. Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the minority party in the short term, but in the long term, the overlords are going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that's going to hurt the overlords. **You can either choose to not hurt others because of empathy, or because you recognize that your lack of empathy will eventually lead others to conspire against you to your ruin, but either way, you should choose to not hurt others.** Which is actually a really nice way of restating my **warning**, even though it might look very different now that I have spent so many words describing it.  (And I feel like this warning applies so widely to Google vs Society in our modern times, may this serve as a warning from the microcosmic to the macrocosmic as well. Take heed, Google.)   Metaphorically, Golang is a lake built and run by Google, which is filled with paper-cut razors and signs welcoming us into the water. Enough people go that many others are swept along with them, and issue #33171 was serving as the complaint department where people would go to complain about the razors. And they continued to complain. And that took energy to deal with. And the overlords don't love their energy being sucked into this issue, particularly because they incorrectly see it as a non-issue.  So today, May 27, 2021, after vitalif joined the conversation and delivered the final straw by pointing out yet another case where the ternary operator improved readability, Golang closed the complaint department by closing and locking issue #33171 as resolved. It is not.  Intentionally repeating myself here: Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the folks screaming in the short term, but in the long term, you're very much going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that's going to hurt you. And Golang. And I very much feel justified saying this is incompetence by the Golang overlords.  Here's why: There really is no right choice between the ternary conditional operator or not. If you google it or scour the scholarly databases of academia, there is certainly not statistically significant evidence suggesting a superior position within this schism. Hence, the reason for the existence of the schism. There's a whole lot of opinions, and they vary widely and deeply. It's like Vim vs Emacs all over again, except there really is no superior position here. (Vim is obviously superior, lol.)  What is evidence-based is the economics of the matter. The lack of a proper right or wrong naturally produces developers randomly on both sides of a schism (think statistical mechanics). That schism has existed since the ternary conditional operator was first introduced. But any languages (and most popular languages) now allow it, which is basically not taking a position in the matter. Those languages don't require it's use or disallow its alternatives. And individual projects can easily disallow its use if those in charge don't want it. So despite the way it looks, most popular languages are actually quite agnostic about the ternary conditional operator. Golang made a different choice, I suspect because of a combination of ignorance and ego. Upon its conception, Golang decided to take a position in the already existing schism (despite no real evidence of a superior side), thereby coupling the language to the schism. It is a foregone conclusion that either Golang will defeat/survive the schism, or the schism will rip it in half (schisming it). It's obvious to me that the overlords will lose here. They are up against at least anywhere near half of all their future users. They just don't have enough social power to win that fight. It's not clear to me that any organization of humans on earth is that powerful. Some kind of super dictator power might be sufficient, but software developers are practically wizards or lower deities in our modern society. I wouldn't bet against half of them in literally any fight, except maybe against the other half, but in this case I promise the other half does not care enough.  No, if Google does not change its position and improve its behavior, market forces (demand) will eventually win.  My prediction in March 2020 came from my knowledge of economics, not computer science -- but it's just easy to see the incredible forces of demand on the one side, and the quite impressive stubbornness of the Golang overlords on the other. It doesn't take much to know that something is going to buckle with fairly significant energy.  But there is always a spark that causes the cascade. I am now predicting that today's event was that spark. Of course there is a chance to save it and prevent the fork by allowing the conversation to continue in a more fair environment outside of the Golang overlords' control. Perhaps the overlords won't even show up, in which case I do predict the fork is inevitable. But, perhaps an accord can be reached. I'm hopeful.  Finally, I now predict that if a compromise is not reached between the parties, the language will be forked and the new language will be called De (pronounced Day).  This is a play on words, similar to how Go is the first two letters of Google, but because many people are increasingly looking at Google like a Demon or Devil, the letters would be De instead. So it doubles as a diss against Google for behaving the way it is behaving."
