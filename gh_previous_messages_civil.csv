Gemfile (and the included information from your Pluginfile) is used to define which gems to install when you run bundle install on your project.   So to implement a method like the one you want, at runtime in fastlane, you would then have to change both the Gemfile to include the new imported data, and run bundle install. It would change files on the file system and also  Probably that would still not work? When running fastlane command via bundle exec no other gem can be loaded as  bundler  disallows loading gems that are not in the bundle. So when import from git is called in  fastlane  runtime,  bundler  runtime environment has already been created and won't allow any other gems to be loaded.  However, the only solution that comes to my mind, to make it work with  bundler , would be to nest another call to bundle exec but with a temporary Gemfile. This temporary  Gemfile  would include all the entries from a  project   Gemfile / Pluginfile  and all the entries from an  imported   Gemfile / Pluginfile  (as  Gemfile  is actually calling eval gemfile on a  Pluginfile  so it is like those entries would be in a  Gemfile ). No modification of a current  Gemfile  or any other file is needed.  But this is  **not a good** idea ,), and it would only work if import from git was at the beginning of a  Fastfile  - it would be the most convenient to just call bundle exec with the same command and parameters as the original one. One caveat of it is that it nests with each import from git call over and over again... The other one is that if import from git is not placed at the top of a  Fastfile  it means some lanes or anything else might already been executed and would require to somehow reuse this  fastlane  state in a new bundle exec call... Terrible idea that is why I am hiding it in the details ˜  So I guess it **cannot** be done due to usage of  bundler . **But** if one is **not using**  bundler  in a project (and hence both  Gemfile  and  Pluginfile ), then they could just add plugins via fastlane require action in a project  Fastfile  or in an imported  Fastfile .

Documentation of that actions says:    Import another Fastfile from a remote git repository to use its lanes   That is pretty clear that this action is for importing Fastfiles.  Exactly, that is why I was surprised that it imports all the files of custom actions as well and not only a  Fastfile  ,). It is not even mentioned. And as plugins are just actions this is probably why people think that remote plugins should be imported or actually expect them to be imported implicitly like in a case of custom actions. Besides, searching for issues regarding import from git and  Pluginfile  yields a lot of results so it seems like it is not so obvious for people and they constantly ask to support  Pluginfile  in import from git. Hence, I think an explanation with a good reasoning would be welcomed. Maybe it would be great to add a warning when import from git detects a  Pluginfile  to remind that plugins should be installed/updated. I think it would follow  fastlane philosophy .   What do you mean by that? How should this work?  What I meant is that when import from git detects a  remote   Pluginfile  (meaning in the same directory as the  Fastfile  it tries to import) it could print a warning listing the plugin names and saying that in order to use this  remote   Fastfile  these plugins are required to be in a  local   Pluginfile . It could even compare a  local   Pluginfile  with a remote one and throw an error when it detects that plugins from a remote are not included in the local one. It would be very informative and helpful. Or  fastlane require plugin  could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project  Pluginfile ?  Doesn't this already happen when you use an action of a plugin, that is not installed?  Yes I know that calling a plugin action would end up with an error but a usage of such an action might be somewhere far down the lanes ˜„  i.e. after a long build or anything else. I think it is better to prevent such a  Fastfile  from running at all as it will almost certainly finish with an error - so why wait for that? This is just another way of prevention I have described above. This time using a fastlane require plugin as an action in a  remote   Fastfile . Instead of adding a  remote   Pluginfile  (like in a case above and handle that  Pluginfile  in import from git) you could specify directly in a  remote   Fastfile  that some plugins are required via fastlane require plugin action - this would work like in a case above - check if these plugins are in a  local   Pluginfile  and then throw an error if missing.  Both of these preventions of course make sense if one is using  bundler ,  Gemfile  and  Pluginfile . Otherwise it is enough to use the current fastlane require action and it will install a particular plugin gem (if necessary) upon running any lane from such a  Fastfile . So now both usages are handled.  That being said: You can of course create an action in your shared Fastfile that does exactly what I described above. Download some file, edit Pluginfile (or create it if it doesn'T exist) or add it additionally to Gemfile, then run bundle install using the sh() action.

Second, it seems like it would just cause problems for normal situations like: Here, the continuation lines need to be indented 9 columns to maintain alignment.  Replacing these with tabs just breaks this.  Even if it was on some tab multiple for some developers, it might not be for others.  In general, I think all developers on the team (including CI) should operate on a bit-for-bit identical version of the code for many important reasons. I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options."

I truly do want to fix this as we have under-served tabs users in the past and want to ensure it is just a viable and useful as spaces.  Let's talk potential solutions (setting aside for a moment the engineering cost) and see if we can agree on which one would be most helpful. Once we agree on a design, we can evaluate the engineering difficulty of it.  ## Tabs only mode  Simplest solution would be to have an option that means ""if this option is  on  Tabs are never allowed to be converted to spaces by the formatter"". I will tentatively call this  Tabs only mode  (since sadly ""Always"" is taken). I think this will operate like folks want but there is a corner case that has been called out that we need to consider which is what if we can't perfectly align things with just tabs?. So, if you set your tabs to some indenting (like say ""4"") we would try to get you as close as we can based on those settings with the understanding that we could be off by one or more. This would be an example of a worst-case scenario where we could choose to either be off by  one  or  three  when tabs have an indent size of 4.  I think intuitively we would say ""We should be off by as little as possible"". So, for worst case scenarios like the ones above we would choose option 2 over option 1.
